chapter ii

occasion dure the follow month i drop in at  wall street
to inquir how the repair and refurnish of the vessel was come
on how addit to the passeng list were averag how mani peopl
the committe were decre not select everi day and banish in
sorrow and tribul i was glad to know that we were to have a littl
print press on board and issu a daili newspap of our own i was
glad to learn that our piano our parlor organ and our melodeon were to
be the best instrument of the kind that could be had in the market i
was proud to observ that among our excursionist were three minist of
the gospel eight doctor sixteen or eighteen ladi sever militari
and naval chieftain with sound titl an ampl crop of professors
of various kind and a gentleman who had commission of the unit
state of america to europ asia and africa thunder after his name
in one aw blast i had care prepar myself to take rather a
back seat in that ship becaus of the uncommon select materi that
would alon be permit to pass through the camel eye of that
committe on credenti i had school myself to expect an impos
array of militari and naval hero and to have to set that back seat
still further back in consequ of it mayb but i state frank that i
was all unprepar for this crusher

i fell under that titular avalanch a torn and blight thing i said
that if that potent must go over in our ship whi i suppos he must
but that to my think when the unit state consid it necessari
to send a dignitari of that tonnag across the ocean it would be in
better tast and safer to take him apart and cart him over in section
in sever ship

ah if i had onli known then that he was onli a common mortal and that
his mission had noth more overpow about it than the collect of
seed and uncommon yam and extraordinari cabbag and peculiar bullfrog
for that poor useless innoc mildew old fossil the smithsonian
institut i would have felt so much reliev

dure that memor month i bask in the happi of be for onc
in my life drift with the tide of a great popular movement everybodi
was go to europei too was go to europ everybodi was go to
the famous pari expositioni too was go to the pari exposit
the steamship line were carri american out of the various port of
the countri at the rate of four or five thousand a week in the aggreg
if i met a dozen individu dure that month who were not go to
europ short i have no distinct remembr of it now i walk about
the citi a good deal with a young mr blucher who was book for the
excurs he was confid goodnatur unsophist
companion but he was not a man to set the river on fire he had the
most extraordinari notion about this european exodus and came at last to
consid the whole nation as pack up for emigr to franc we
step into a store on broadway one day where he bought a handkerchief
and when the man could not make chang mr b said

never mind ill hand it to you in pari 

but i am not go to pari 

how iswhat did i understand you to say 

i said i am not go to pari 

not go to pari not g well then where in the nation are you
go to 

nowher at all 

not anywher whatsoev not ani place on earth but this 

not ani place at all but just thisstay here all summer 

my comrad took his purchas and walk out of the store without a word
walk out with an injur look upon his counten up the street
apiec he broke silenc and said impress it was a liethat is my
opinion of it 

in the full of time the ship was readi to receiv her passeng
i was introduc to the young gentleman who was to be my roommat and
found him to be intellig cheer of spirit unselfish full of
generous impuls patient consider and wonder goodnatur
not ani passeng that sail in the quaker citi will withhold his
endors of what i have just said we select a stateroom forward of
the wheel on the starboard side below deck  it had two berth in
it a dismal deadlight a sink with a washbowl in it and a long
sumptuous cushion locker which was to do servic as a
sofapartlyand part as a hide place for our thing notwithstand all this
furnitur there was still room to turn around in but not to swing a cat
in at least with entir secur to the cat howev the room was
larg for a ship stateroom and was in everi way satisfactori

the vessel was appoint to sail on a certain saturday earli in june

a littl after noon on that distinguish saturday i reach the ship and
went on board all was bustl and confus i have seen that remark
befor somewher  the pier was crowd with carriag and men
passeng were arriv and hurri on board the vessel deck were
encumb with trunk and valis group of excursionist array in
unattract travel costum were mope about in a drizzl rain
and look as droopi and woebegon as so mani molt chicken the
gallant flag was up but it was under the spell too and hung limp and
dishearten by the mast altogeth it was the bluest bluest
spectacl it was a pleasur excursionther was no gainsay that
becaus the program said soit was so nomin in the bondbut it
sure hadnt the general aspect of one

final abov the bang and rumbl and shout and hiss of
steam rang the order to cast off a sudden rush to the gangwaysa
scamper ashor of visitorsa revolut of the wheel and we were
offth picnic was begun two veri mild cheer went up from the
drip crowd on the pier we answer them gentl from the slipperi
deck the flag made an effort to wave and fail the batteri of guns
spake notth ammunit was out

we steam down to the foot of the harbor and came to anchor it was
still rain and not onli rain but storm outside we could
see ourselv that there was a tremend sea on we must lie still
in the calm harbor till the storm should abat our passeng hail
from fifteen state onli a few of them had ever been to sea befor
manifest it would not do to pit them against a fullblown tempest until
they had got their sealeg on toward even the two steam tug that
had accompani us with a rollick champagneparti of young new yorker
on board who wish to bid farewel to one of our number in due and
ancient form depart and we were alon on the deep on deep five
fathom and anchor fast to the bottom and out in the solemn rain at
that this was pleasur with a vengeanc

it was an appropri relief when the gong sound for prayer meet
the first saturday night of ani other pleasur excurs might have been
devot to whist and danc but i submit it to the unprejud mind if
it would have been in good tast for us to engag in such frivol
consid what we had gone through and the frame of mind we were in
we would have shone at a wake but not at anyth more festiv

howev there is alway a cheer influenc about the sea and in my
berth that night rock by the measur swell of the wave and lull by
the murmur of the distant surf i soon pass tranquilli out of all
conscious of the dreari experi of the day and damag
premonit of the futur




chapter iii

all day sunday at anchor the storm had gone down a great deal but the
sea had not it was still pile it frothi hill high in air outsid 
as we could plain see with the glass we could not proper begin a
pleasur excurs on sunday we could not offer untri stomach to so
pitiless a sea as that we must lie still till monday and we did but
we had repetit of church and prayermeet and so of cours we
were just as elig situat as we could have been ani where

i was up earli that sabbath morn and was earli to breakfast i felt a
perfect natur desir to have a good long unprejud look at the
passeng at a time when they should be free from selfconsci
which is at breakfast when such a moment occur in the live of human
be at all

i was great surpris to see so mani elder peoplei might almost
say so mani vener peopl a glanc at the long line of head was
apt to make one think it was all gray but it was not there was a
toler fair sprinkl of young folk and anoth fair sprinkl of
gentlemen and ladi who were noncommitt as to age be neither
actual old or absolut young

the next morn we weigh anchor and went to sea it was a great
happi to get away after this drag dispirit delay i thought
there never was such glad in the air befor such bright in the
sun such beauti in the sea i was satisfi with the picnic then and
with all it belong all my malici instinct were dead within me
and as america fade out of sight i think a spirit of chariti rose up in
their place that was as boundless for the time be as the broad ocean
that was heav it billow about us i wish to express my feel
i wish to lift up my voic and sing but i did not know anyth to
sing and so i was oblig to give up the idea it was no loss to the
ship though perhap

it was breezi and pleasant but the sea was still veri rough one could
not promenad without risk his neck at one moment the bowsprit was
take a dead aim at the sun in midheaven and at the next it was
tri to harpoon a shark in the bottom of the ocean what a weird
sensat it is to feel the stern of a ship sink swift from under you
and see the bow climb high away among the cloud one safest cours
that day was to clasp a rail and hang on walk was too precari a
pastim

by some happi fortun i was not seasick that was a thing to be proud
of i had not alway escap befor if there is one thing in the world
that will make a man peculiar and insuffer selfconceit it is to
have his stomach behav itself the first day at sea when near all his
comrad are seasick soon a vener fossil shawl to the chin and
bandag like a mummi appear at the door of the after deckhous and
the next lurch of the ship shot him into my arm i said

goodmorn sir it is a fine day 

he put his hand on his stomach and said oh my  and then stagger
away and fell over the coop of a skylight

present anoth old gentleman was project from the same door with
great violenc i said

calm yourself sirther is no hurri it is a fine day sir 

he also put his hand on his stomach and said oh my  and reel away

in a littl while anoth veteran was discharg abrupt from the same
door claw at the air for a save support i said

good morn sir it is a fine day for pleasur you were about to
say

oh my 

i thought so i anticip him anyhow i stay there and was
bombard with old gentlemen for an hour perhap and all i got out of
ani of them was oh my 

i went away then in a thought mood i said this is a good pleasur
excurs i like it the passeng are not garrul but still they
are sociabl i like those old peopl but somehow they all seem to have
the oh my rather bad

i knew what was the matter with them they were seasick and i was glad
of it we all like to see peopl seasick when we are not ourselv
play whist by the cabin lamp when it is storm outsid is pleasant
walk the quarterdeck in the moonlight is pleasant smoke in the
breezi foretop is pleasant when one is not afraid to go up there but
these are all feebl and commonplac compar with the joy of see
peopl suffer the miseri of seasick

i pick up a good deal of inform dure the afternoon at one time
i was climb up the quarterdeck when the vessel stem was in the sky
i was smoke a cigar and feel passabl comfort somebodi
ejacul

come now that wont answer read the sign up thereno smoke abaft
the wheel 

it was captain duncan chief of the expedit i went forward of
cours i saw a long spyglass lie on a desk in one of the upperdeck
stateroom back of the pilothous and reach after itther was a
ship in the distanc

ah ahhand off come out of that 

i came out of that i said to a decksweepbut in a low voic

who is that overgrown pirat with the whisker and the discord
voic 

it captain bursleyexecut officersail master 

i loiter about awhil and then for want of someth better to do
fell to carv a rail with my knife somebodi said in an
insinu admonitori voic

now saymi frienddont you know ani better than to be whittl the
ship all to piec that way you ought to know better than that 

i went back and found the deck sweep

who is that smoothfac anim outrag yonder in the fine cloth 

that captain l the owner of the shiph one of the main
boss 

in the cours of time i brought up on the starboard side of the
pilothous and found a sextant lie on a bench now i said they
take the sun through this thing i should think i might see that vessel
through it i had hard got it to my eye when someon touch me on the
shoulder and said deprec

ill have to get you to give that to me sir if there anyth youd
like to know about take the sun id as soon tell you as notbut i
dont like to trust anybodi with that instrument if you want ani
figur doneay aye sir 

he was gone to answer a call from the other side i sought the
decksweep

who is that spiderleg gorilla yonder with the sanctimoni
counten 

it captain jone sirth chief mate 

well this goe clear away ahead of anyth i ever heard of befor
do younow i ask you as a man and a brotherdo you think i could
ventur to throw a rock here in ani given direct without hit a
captain of this ship 

well sir i dont knowi think like youd fetch the captain of the
watch may be becaus he astand right yonder in the way 

i went belowmedit and a littl downheart i thought if five
cook can spoil a broth what may not five captain do with a pleasur
excurs

hors billiard  hors billiard is a fine game it afford good
activ exercis hilar and consum excit it is a mixtur of
hopscotch and shuffleboard play with a crutch a larg hopscotch
diagram is mark out on the deck with chalk and each compart
number you stand off three or four step with some broad wooden
disk befor you on the deck and these you send forward with a vigor
thrust of a long crutch if a disk stop on a chalk line it doe not
count anyth if it stop in divis no  it count  in  it
count  and so on the game is  and four can play at a time that
game would be veri simpl play on a stationari floor but with us to
play it well requir scienc we had to allow for the reel of the
ship to the right or the left veri often one made calcul for a
heel to the right and the ship did not go that way the consequ was
that that disk miss the whole hopscotch plan a yard or two and then
there was humili on one side and laughter on the other

when it rain the passeng had to stay in the hous of courseor at
least the cabinsand amus themselv with game read look out
of the window at the veri familiar billow and talk gossip

by  oclock in the even dinner was about over an hour promenad
on the upper deck follow then the gong sound and a larg major of
the parti repair to the after cabin upper a handsom saloon fifti or
sixti feet long for prayer the unregener call this saloon the
synagogu  the devot consist onli of two hymn from the plymouth
collect and a short prayer and seldom occupi more than fifteen
minut the hymn were accompani by parlororgan music when the sea
was smooth enough to allow a perform to sit at the instrument without
be lash to his chair

after prayer the synagogu short took the semblanc of a write
school the like of that pictur was never seen in a ship befor
behind the long dine tabl on either side of the saloon and scatter
from one end to the other of the latter some twenti or thirti gentlemen
and ladi sat them down under the sway lamp and for two or three
hour wrote dilig in their journal ala that journal so
volumin begun should come to so lame and impot a conclus as
most of them did i doubt if there is a singl pilgrim of all that host
but can show a hundr fair page of journal concern the first twenti
day voyag in the quaker citi and i am moral certain that not ten
of the parti can show twenti page of journal for the succeed twenti
thousand mile of voyag at certain period it becom the dearest
ambit of a man to keep a faith record of his perform in a
book and he dash at this work with an enthusiasm that impos on him
the notion that keep a journal is the veriest pastim in the world
and the pleasantest but if he onli live twentyon day he will find
out that onli those rare natur that are made up of pluck endur
devot to duti for duti sake and invinc determin may hope
to ventur upon so tremend an enterpris as the keep of a journal
and not sustain a shame defeat

one of our favorit youth jack a splendid young fellow with a head
full of good sens and a pair of leg that were a wonder to look upon in
the way of length and straight and slim use to report progress
everi morn in the most glow and spirit way and say

oh im come along bulli  he was a littl given to slang in his
happier mood i wrote ten page in my journal last nightand you
know i wrote nine the night befor and twelv the night befor that
whi it onli fun 

what do you find to put in it jack 

oh everyth latitud and longitud noon everi day and how mani
mile we made last twentyfour hour and all the domino game i beat and
hors billiard and whale and shark and porpois and the text of the
sermon sunday becaus thatll tell at home you know and the ship we
salut and what nation they were and which way the wind was and
whether there was a heavi sea and what sail we carri though we dont
ever carri ani princip go against a head wind alwayswond
what is the reason of that and how mani lie moult has toldoh everi
thing iv got everyth down my father told me to keep that
journal father wouldnt take a thousand dollar for it when i get it
done 

no jack it will be worth more than a thousand dollarswhen you get it
done 

do you no but do you think it will though

ye it will be worth at least as much as a thousand dollarswhen you
get it done may be more 

well i about half think so myself it aint no slouch of a journal 

but it short becam a most lament slouch of a journal  one night
in pari after a hard day toil in sightse i said

now ill go and stroll around the cafe awhil jack and give you a
chanc to write up your journal old fellow 

his counten lost it fire he said

well no you neednt mind i think i wont run that journal anymor
it is aw tedious do you knowi reckon im as much as four thousand
page behind hand i havent got ani franc in it at all first i
thought id leav franc out and start fresh but that wouldnt do
would it the governor would say hello heredidnt see anyth in

oh i dont think a journal ani usedo you theyr onli a bother
aint they 

ye a journal that is incomplet isnt of much use but a journal
proper kept is worth a thousand dollarswhen youv got it done 

a thousand well i should think so i wouldnt finish it for a
million 

his experi was onli the experi of the major of that
industri night school in the cabin if you wish to inflict a
heartless and malign punish upon a young person pledg him to
keep a journal a year

a good mani expedi were resort to to keep the excursionist amus
and satisfi a club was form of all the passeng which met in
the write school after prayer and read aloud about the countri we
were approach and discuss the inform so obtain

sever time the photograph of the expedit brought out his
transpar pictur and gave us a handsom magiclantern exhibit
his view were near all of foreign scene but there were one or two
home pictur among them he advertis that he would open his
perform in the after cabin at two bell nine p m and show the
passeng where they shall eventu arrivewhich was all veri well
but by a funni accid the first pictur that flame out upon the canva
was a view of greenwood cemeteri

on sever starlight night we danc on the upper deck under the
awn and made someth of a ballroom display of brillianc by
hang a number of ship lantern to the stanchion our music
consist of the wellmix strain of a melodeon which was a littl
asthmat and apt to catch it breath where it ought to come out strong
a clarinet which was a littl unreli on the high key and rather
melancholi on the low one and a disreput accordion that had a leak
somewher and breath louder than it squawkeda more eleg term doe
not occur to me just now howev the danc was infinit wors than
the music when the ship roll to starboard the whole platoon of
dancer came charg down to starboard with it and brought up in mass
at the rail and when it roll to port they went flounder down to
port with the same unanim of sentiment waltzer spun around
precari for a matter of fifteen second and then went scurri down
to the rail as if they meant to go overboard the virginia reel as
perform on board the quaker citi had more genuin reel about it than
ani reel i ever saw befor and was as full of interest to the spectat
as it was full of desper chanc and hairbreadth escap to the
particip we gave up danc final

we celebr a ladi birthday anniversari with toast speech a
poem and so forth we also had a mock trial no ship ever went to sea
that hadnt a mock trial on board the purser was accus of steal an
overcoat from stateroom no  a judg was appoint also clerk a
crier of the court constabl sheriff counsel for the state and for
the defend wit were subpoena and a juri empanel after much
challeng the wit were stupid and unreli and contradictori
as wit alway are the counsel were eloqu argument and
vindict abus of each other as was characterist and proper
the case was at last submit and duli finish by the judg with an
absurd decis and a ridicul sentenc

the act of charad was tri on sever even by the young
gentlemen and ladi in the cabin and prove the most distinguish
success of all the amus experi

an attempt was made to organ a debat club but it was a failur
there was no orator talent in the ship

we all enjoy ourselvesi think i can safe say that but it was in a
rather quiet way we veri veri seldom play the piano we play the
flute and the clarinet togeth and made good music too what there was
of it but we alway play the same old tune it was a veri pretti tune
how well i rememb iti wonder when i shall ever get rid of it we
never play either the melodeon or the organ except at devotionsbut i
am too fast young albert did know part of a tune someth about
o somethingoroth how sweet it is to know that he his
whatshisname i do not rememb the exact titl of it but it was
veri plaintiv and full of sentiment albert play that pretti much
all the time until we contract with him to restrain himself but
nobodi ever sang by moonlight on the upper deck and the congreg
sing at church and prayer was not of a superior order of
architectur i put up with it as long as i could and then join in
and tri to improv it but this encourag young georg to join in
too and that made a failur of it becaus georg voic was just
turn  and when he was sing a dismal sort of bass it was apt to
fli off the handl and startl everybodi with a most discord cackl
on the upper note georg didnt know the tune either which was
also a drawback to his perform i said

come now georg dont improvis it look too egotist it will
provok remark just stick to coron  like the other it is a
good tuneyou cant improv it ani just offhand in this way 

whi im not tri to improv itand i am sing like the other
just as it is in the note 

and he honest thought he was too and so he had no one to blame but
himself when his voic caught on the center occasion and gave him the
lockjaw

there were those among the unregener who attribut the unceas
headwind to our distress choirmus there were those who said
open that it was take chanc enough to have such ghast music go
on even when it was at it best and that to exagger the crime by
let georg help was simpli fli in the face of provid these
said that the choir would keep up their lacer attempt at melodi
until they would bring down a storm some day that would sink the ship

there were even grumbler at the prayer the execut offic said the
pilgrim had no chariti

there they are down there everi night at eight bell pray for fair
windswhen they know as well as i do that this is the onli ship go
east this time of the year but there a thousand come westwhat a
fair wind for us is a head wind to themth almighti blow a fair
wind for a thousand vessel and this tribe want him to turn it clear
around so as to accommod oneand she a steamship at that it aint
good sens it aint good reason it aint good christian it aint
common human chariti avast with such nonsens 




chapter v

take it bi and larg  as the sailor say we had a pleasant ten day
run from new york to the azor islandsnot a fast run for the distanc
is onli twentyfour hundr mile but a right pleasant one in the main
true we had head wind all the time and sever stormi experi
which sent fifti percent of the passeng to bed sick and made the ship
look dismal and desertedstormi experi that all will rememb who
weather them on the tumbl deck and caught the vast sheet of spray
that everi now and then sprang high in air from the weather bow and swept
the ship like a thundershow but for the most part we had balmi summer
weather and night that were even finer than the day we had the
phenomenon of a full moon locat just in the same spot in the heaven at
the same hour everi night the reason of this singular conduct on the
part of the moon did not occur to us at first but it did afterward when
we reflect that we were gain about twenti minut everi day becaus
we were go east so fastw gain just about enough everi day to keep
along with the moon it was becom an old moon to the friend we had
left behind us but to us joshua it stood still in the same place and
remain alway the same

young mr blucher who is from the far west and is on his first voyag
was a good deal worri by the constant chang ship time  he was
proud of his new watch at first and use to drag it out prompt when
eight bell struck at noon but he came to look after a while as if he
were lose confid in it seven day out from new york he came on
deck and said with great decis

this thing a swindl 

what a swindl 

whi this watch i bought her out in illinoisgav  for herand i
thought she was good and by georg she is good onshor but somehow
she dont keep up her lick here on the waterget seasick may be she
skip she run along regular enough till halfpast eleven and then all
of a sudden she let down iv set that old regul up faster and
faster till iv shove it clear around but it dont do ani good she
just distanc everi watch in the ship and clatter along in a way
that astonish till it is noon but them eight bell alway get in
about ten minut ahead of her anyway i dont know what to do with her
now she do all she cansh go her best gait but it wont
save her now dont you know there aint a watch in the ship that
make better time than she is but what doe it signifi when you hear
them eight bell youll find her just about ten minut short of her
score sure 

the ship was gain a full hour everi three day and this fellow was
tri to make his watch go fast enough to keep up to her but as he
had said he had push the regul up as far as it would go and the
watch was on it best gait  and so noth was left him but to fold his
hand and see the ship beat the race we sent him to the captain and he
explain to him the mysteri of ship time and set his troubl mind at
rest this young man ask a great mani question about seasick
befor we left and want to know what it characterist were and how
he was to tell when he had it he found out

we saw the usual shark blackfish porpois etc of cours and by and
by larg school of portugues menofwar were ad to the regular list
of sea wonder some of them were white and some of a brilliant carmin
color the nautilus is noth but a transpar web of jelli that
spread itself to catch the wind and has fleshylook string a foot
or two long dangl from it to keep it steadi in the water it is an
accomplish sailor and has good sailor judgment it reef it sail when
a storm threaten or the wind blow pretti hard and furl it entir
and goe down when a gale blow ordinarili it keep it sail wet and in
good sail order by turn over and dip it in the water for a
moment seamen say the nautilus is onli found in these water between
the th and th parallel of latitud

at three oclock on the morn of the twentyfirst of june we were
awaken and notifi that the azor island were in sight i said i
did not take ani interest in island at three oclock in the morn
but anoth persecutor came and then anoth and anoth and final
believ that the general enthusiasm would permit no one to slumber in
peac i got up and went sleepili on deck it was five and a half
oclock now and a raw bluster morn the passeng were huddl
about the smokestack and fortifi behind ventil and all were
wrap in wintri costum and look sleepi and unhappi in the pitiless
gale and the drench spray

the island in sight was flore it seem onli a mountain of mud
stand up out of the dull mist of the sea but as we bore down upon
it the sun came out and made it a beauti picturea mass of green
farm and meadow that swell up to a height of fifteen hundr feet and
mingl it upper outlin with the cloud it was rib with sharp
steep ridg and cloven with narrow canyon and here and there on the
height rocki upheav shape themselv into mimic battlement and
castl and out of rift cloud came broad shaft of sunlight that
paint summit and slope and glen with band of fire and left belt of
somber shade between it was the aurora boreali of the frozen pole
exil to a summer land

we skirt around twothird of the island four mile from shore and
all the opera glass in the ship were call into requisit to settl
disput as to whether mossi spot on the upland were grove of tree or
grove of weed or whether the white villag down by the sea were
realli villag or onli the cluster tombston of cemeteri final
we stood to sea and bore away for san miguel and flore short becam a
dome of mud again and sank down among the mist and disappear but to
mani a seasick passeng it was good to see the green hill again and
all were more cheer after this episod than anybodi could have
expect them to be consid how sin earli they had gotten up

but we had to chang our purpos about san miguel for a storm came up
about noon that so toss and pitch the vessel that common sens
dictat a run for shelter therefor we steer for the nearest island
of the groupfay the peopl there pronounc it fyal and put the
accent on the first syllabl we anchor in the open roadstead of
horta half a mile from the shore the town has eight thousand to ten
thousand inhabit it snowwhit hous nestl cosili in a sea of
fresh green veget and no villag could look prettier or more
attract it sit in the lap of an amphitheat of hill which are
three hundr to seven hundr feet high and care cultiv clear
to their summitsnot a foot of soil left idl everi farm and everi
acr is cut up into littl squar inclosur by stone wall whose duti
it is to protect the grow product from the destruct gale that
blow there these hundr of green squar mark by their black lava
wall make the hill look like vast checkerboard

the island belong to portug and everyth in fayal has portugues
characterist about it but more of that anon a swarm of swarthi
noisi lie shouldershrug gesticul portugues boatmen with
brass ring in their ear and fraud in their heart climb the ship
side and various parti of us contract with them to take us ashor
at so much a head silver coin of ani countri we land under the wall
of a littl fort arm with batteri of twelveandthirtytwopound
which horta consid a most formid institut but if we were ever
to get after it with one of our turret monitor they would have to
move it out in the countri if they want it where they could go and find
it again when they need it the group on the pier was a rusti onemen
and women and boy and girl all rag and barefoot uncomb and
unclean and by instinct educ and profess beggar they
troop after us and never more while we tarri in fayal did we get rid
of them we walk up the middl of the princip street and these
vermin surround us on all side and glare upon us and everi moment
excit coupl shot ahead of the process to get a good look back
just as villag boy do when they accompani the eleph on his
advertis trip from street to street it was veri flatter to me to
be part of the materi for such a sensat here and there in the
doorway we saw women with fashion portugues hood on this hood is
of thick blue cloth attach to a cloak of the same stuff and is a
marvel of ugli it stand up high and spread far abroad and is
unfathom deep it fit like a circus tent and a woman head is
hidden away in it like the man who prompt the singer from his tin
shed in the stage of an opera there is no particl of trim about
this monstrous capot as they call itit is just a plain ugli
deadblu mass of sail and a woman cant go within eight point of the
wind with one of them on she has to go befor the wind or not at all
the general style of the capot is the same in all the island and will
remain so for the next ten thousand year but each island shape it
capot just enough differ from the other to enabl an observ to
tell at a glanc what particular island a ladi hail from

the portugues penni or rei pronounc ray are prodigi it
take one thousand rei to make a dollar and all financi estim are

chapter vi

i think the azor must be veri littl known in america out of our
whole ship compani there was not a solitari individu who knew
anyth whatev about them some of the parti well read concern
most other land had no other inform about the azor than that
they were a group of nine or ten small island far out in the atlant
someth more than halfway between new york and gibraltar that was
all these consider move me to put in a paragraph of dri fact
just here

the communiti is emin portuguesethat is to say it is slow poor
shiftless sleepi and lazi there is a civil governor appoint by the
king of portug and also a militari governor who can assum suprem
control and suspend the civil govern at his pleasur the island
contain a popul of about   almost entir portugues
everyth is staid and settl for the countri was one hundr year
old when columbus discov america the princip crop is corn and
they rais it and grind it just as their greatgreatgreatgrandfath
did they plow with a board slight shod with iron their trifl
littl harrow are drawn by men and women small windmil grind the
corn ten bushel a day and there is one assist superintend to
feed the mill and a general superintend to stand by and keep him from
go to sleep when the wind chang they hitch on some donkey and
actual turn the whole upper half of the mill around until the sail are
in proper posit instead of fix the concern so that the sail could
be move instead of the mill oxen tread the wheat from the ear after
the fashion preval in the time of methuselah there is not a
wheelbarrow in the landthey carri everyth on their head or on
donkey or in a wickerbodi cart whose wheel are solid block of
wood and whose axl turn with the wheel there is not a modern plow in
the island or a thresh machin all attempt to introduc them have
fail the good cathol portugues cross himself and pray god to
shield him from all blasphem desir to know more than his father did
befor him the climat is mild they never have snow or ice and i saw
no chimney in the town the donkey and the men women and children of
a famili all eat and sleep in the same room and are unclean are ravag
by vermin and are truli happi the peopl lie and cheat the stranger
and are desper ignor and have hard ani rever for their
dead the latter trait show how littl better they are than the donkey
they eat and sleep with the onli welldress portugues in the camp
are the half a dozen welltodo famili the jesuit priest and the
soldier of the littl garrison the wage of a labor are twenti to
twentyfour cent a day and those of a good mechan about twice as
much they count it in rei at a thousand to the dollar and this make
them rich and content fine grape use to grow in the island and an
excel wine was made and export but a diseas kill all the vine
fifteen year ago and sinc that time no wine has been made the
island be wholli of volcan origin the soil is necessarili veri
rich near everi foot of ground is under cultiv and two or three
crop a year of each articl are produc but noth is export save a
few orangeschiefli to england nobodi come here and nobodi goe
away news is a thing unknown in fayal a thirst for it is a passion
equal unknown a portugues of averag intellig inquir if our
civil war was over becaus he said somebodi had told him it wasor
at least it ran in his mind that somebodi had told him someth like
that and when a passeng gave an offic of the garrison copi of the
tribun the herald and time he was surpris to find later news in
them from lisbon than he had just receiv by the littl month steamer
he was told that it came by cabl he said he knew they had tri to lay
a cabl ten year ago but it had been in his mind somehow that they
hadnt succeed

it is in communiti like this that jesuit humbuggeri flourish we
visit a jesuit cathedr near two hundr year old and found in it a
piec of the verit cross upon which our saviour was crucifi it
was polish and hard and in as excel a state of preserv as if
the dread tragedi on calvari had occur yesterday instead of eighteen
centuri ago but these confid peopl believ in that piec of wood
unhesit

in a chapel of the cathedr is an altar with face of solid silverat
least they call it so and i think myself it would go a coupl of hundr
to the ton to speak after the fashion of the silver miner and befor
it is kept forev burn a small lamp a devout ladi who die left
money and contract for unlimit mass for the repos of her soul and
also stipul that this lamp should be kept light alway day and
night she did all this befor she die you understand it is a veri
small lamp and a veri dim one and it could not work her much damag i
think if it went out altogeth

the great altar of the cathedr and also three or four minor one are a
perfect mass of gilt gimcrack and gingerbread and they have a swarm of
rusti dusti batter apostl stand around the filagre work some
on one leg and some with one eye out but a gamey look in the other and
some with two or three finger gone and some with not enough nose left
to blowal of them crippl and discourag and fitter subject for
the hospit than the cathedr

the wall of the chancel are of porcelain all pictur over with figur
of almost life size veri eleg wrought and dress in the fanci
costum of two centuri ago the design was a histori of someth or
somebodi but none of us were learn enough to read the stori the old
father repos under a stone close by date  might have told us
if he could have risen but he didnt

as we came down through the town we encount a squad of littl donkey
readi saddl for use the saddl were peculiar to say the least
they consist of a sort of sawbuck with a small mattress on it and
this furnitur cover about half the donkey there were no stirrup
but realli such support were not neededto use such a saddl was the
next thing to ride a dinner tablether was ampl support clear out to
one knee joint a pack of rag portugues mulet crowd around
us offer their beast at half a dollar an hourmor rascal to the
stranger for the market price is sixteen cent half a dozen of us
mount the ungain affair and submit to the indign of make a
ridicul spectacl of ourselv through the princip street of a town
of   inhabit

we start it was not a trot a gallop or a canter but a stamped
and made up of all possibl or conceiv gait no spur were
necessari there was a mulet to everi donkey and a dozen volunt
besid and they bang the donkey with their goad stick and prick
them with their spike and shout someth that sound like
sekkiyah  and kept up a din and a racket that was wors than bedlam
itself these rascal were all on foot but no matter they were alway
up to timethey can outrun and outlast a donkey altogeth our was
a live and a picturesqu process and drew crowd audienc to the
balconi wherev we went

blucher could do noth at all with his donkey the beast scamper
zigzag across the road and the other ran into him he scrape blucher
against cart and the corner of hous the road was fenc in with high
stone wall and the donkey gave him a polish first on one side and
then on the other but never onc took the middl he final came to the
hous he was born in and dart into the parlor scrape blucher off at
the doorway after remount blucher said to the mulet now
that enough you know you go slow hereaft 

but the fellow knew no english and did not understand so he simpli said
sekkiyah  and the donkey was off again like a shot he turn a comer
sudden and blucher went over his head and to speak truli everi
mule stumbl over the two and the whole cavalcad was pile up in a
heap no harm done a fall from one of those donkey is of littl more
consequ than roll off a sofa the donkey all stood still after
the catastroph and wait for their dismemb saddl to be patch up
and put on by the noisi mulet blucher was pretti angri and want
to swear but everi time he open his mouth his anim did so also and
let off a seri of bray that drown all other sound

it was fun scurri around the breezi hill and through the beauti
canyon there was that rare thing novelti about it it was a fresh
new exhilar sensat this donkey ride and worth a hundr worn
and threadbar home pleasur

the road were a wonder and well they might be here was an island with
onli a hand of peopl in it and yet such fine road do not
exist in the unit state outsid of central park everywher you go
in ani direct you find either a hard smooth level thoroughfar
just sprinkl with black lava sand and border with littl gutter
neat pave with small smooth pebbl or compact pave one like
broadway they talk much of the russ pavement in new york and call it a
new inventionyet here they have been use it in this remot littl
isl of the sea for two hundr year everi street in horta is
handsom pave with the heavi russ block and the surfac is neat and
true as a floornot mar by hole like broadway and everi road is
fenc in by tall solid lava wall which will last a thousand year in
this land where frost is unknown they are veri thick and are often
plaster and whitewash and cap with project slab of cut stone
tree from garden abov hang their sway tendril down and contrast
their bright green with the whitewash or the black lava of the wall and
make them beauti the tree and vine stretch across these narrow
roadway sometim and so shut out the sun that you seem to be ride
through a tunnel the pavement the road and the bridg are all
govern work

the bridg are of a singl spana singl archof cut stone without a
support and pave on top with flag of lava and ornament pebblework
everywher are wall wall wall and all of them tast and
handsomeand etern substanti and everywher are those marvel
pavement so neat so smooth and so indestruct and if ever road
and street and the outsid of hous were perfect free from ani sign
or semblanc of dirt or dust or mud or uncleanli of ani kind it
is horta it is fayal the lower class of the peopl in their person
and their domicil are not cleanbut there it stopsth town and the
island are miracl of cleanli

we arriv home again final after a tenmil excurs and the
irrepress mulet scamper at our heel through the main street
goad the donkey shout the everlast sekkiyah  and sing
john brown body in ruinous english

when we were dismount and it came to settl the shout and jaw
and swear and quarrel among the mulet and with us was near
deafen one fellow would demand a dollar an hour for the use of his
donkey anoth claim half a dollar for prick him up anoth a
quarter for help in that servic and about fourteen guid present
bill for show us the way through the town and it environ and everi
vagrant of them was more vocifer and more vehement and more frantic
in gestur than his neighbor we paid one guid and paid for one
mulet to each donkey

the mountain on some of the island are veri high we sail along the
shore of the island of pico under a state green pyramid that rose up
with one unbroken sweep from our veri feet to an altitud of   feet
and thrust it summit abov the white cloud like an island adrift in a
fog

we got plenti of fresh orang lemon fig apricot etc in these
azor of cours but i will desist i am not here to write patent
offic report

we are on our way to gibraltar and shall reach there five or six day
out from the azor




chapter vii

a week of buffet a tempestu and relentless sea a week of
seasick and desert cabin of lone quarterdeck drench with
sprayspray so ambiti that it even coat the smokestack thick with
a white crust of salt to their veri top a week of shiver in the
shelter of the lifeboat and deckhous by day and blow suffoc
clouds and boister perform at domino in the smoke room at
night

and the last night of the seven was the stormiest of all there was no
thunder no nois but the pound bow of the ship the keen whistl
of the gale through the cordag and the rush of the seeth water
but the vessel climb aloft as if she would climb to heaventhen paus
an instant that seem a centuri and plung headlong down again as from
a precipic the sheet spray drench the deck like rain the
black of dark was everywher at long interv a flash of
lightn clove it with a quiver line of fire that reveal a heav
world of water where was noth befor kindl the duski cordag to
glitter silver and lit up the face of the men with a ghast luster

fear drove mani on deck that were use to avoid the night wind and
the spray some thought the vessel could not live through the night and
it seem less dread to stand out in the midst of the wild tempest and
see the peril that threaten than to be shut up in the sepulchr
cabin under the dim lamp and imagin the horror that were abroad on
the ocean and onc outonc where they could see the ship struggl
in the strong grasp of the stormonc where they could hear the shriek
of the wind and face the drive spray and look out upon the majest
pictur the lightn disclos they were prison to a fierc
fascin they could not resist and so remain it was a wild night
and a veri veri long one

everybodi was sent scamper to the deck at seven oclock this love
morn of the thirtieth of june with the glad news that land was in
sight it was a rare thing and a joy to see all the ship famili
abroad onc more albeit the happi that sat upon everi counten
could onli part conceal the ravag which that long sieg of storm had
wrought there but dull eye soon sparkl with pleasur pallid cheek
flush again and frame weaken by sick gather new life from the
quicken influenc of the bright fresh morn yea and from a
still more potent influenc the worn castaway were to see the bless
land again and to see it was to bring back that motherland that was in
all their thought

within the hour we were fair within the strait of gibraltar the tall
yellowsplotch hill of africa on our right with their base veil in
a blue haze and their summit swath in cloudsth same be accord
to scriptur which say that cloud and dark are over the land 
the word were spoken of this particular portion of africa i believ
on our left were the graniterib dome of old spain the strait is
onli thirteen mile wide in it narrowest part

at short interv along the spanish shore were quaintlook old stone
towersmoorish we thoughtbut learn better afterward in former
time the morocco rascal use to coast along the spanish main in their
boat till a safe opportun seem to present itself and then dart in
and captur a spanish villag and carri off all the pretti women they
could find it was a pleasant busi and was veri popular the
spaniard built these watchtow on the hill to enabl them to keep a
sharper lookout on the moroccan specul

the pictur on the other hand was veri beauti to eye weari of the
changeless sea and by and by the ship compani grew wonder
cheer but while we stood admir the cloudcap peak and the
lowland robe in misti gloom a finer pictur burst upon us and chain
everi eye like a magneta state ship with canva pile on canva till
she was one tower mass of belli sail she came speed over the
sea like a great bird africa and spain were forgotten all homag was
for the beauti stranger while everybodi gaze she swept superbl by
and flung the star and stripe to the breez quicker than thought
hat and handkerchief flash in the air and a cheer went up she was
beauti beforesh was radiant now mani a one on our deck knew then
for the first time how tame a sight his countri flag is at home
compar to what it is in a foreign land to see it is to see a vision
of home itself and all it idol and feel a thrill that would stir a
veri river of sluggish blood

we were approach the fame pillar of hercul and alreadi the
african one ape hill  a grand old mountain with summit streak with
granit ledg was in sight the other the great rock of gibraltar
was yet to come the ancient consid the pillar of hercul the
head of navig and the end of the world the inform the
ancient didnt have was veri volumin even the prophet wrote book
after book and epistl after epistl yet never onc hint at the
exist of a great contin on our side of the water yet they must
have known it was there i should think

in a few moment a lone and enorm mass of rock stand seem
in the center of the wide strait and appar wash on all side by
the sea swung magnific into view and we need no tedious travel
parrot to tell us it was gibraltar there could not be two rock like
that in one kingdom

the rock of gibraltar is about a mile and a half long i should say by
  to   feet high and a quarter of a mile wide at it base one
side and one end of it come about as straight up out of the sea as the
side of a hous the other end is irregular and the other side is a steep
slant which an armi would find veri difficult to climb at the foot of
this slant is the wall town of gibraltaror rather the town occupi
part of the slant everywhereon hillsid in the precipic by the
sea on the heightseverywher you choos to look gibraltar is clad
with masonri and bristl with gun it make a strike and live
pictur from whatsoev point you contempl it it is push out into
the sea on the end of a flat narrow strip of land and is suggest of
a gob of mud on the end of a shingl a few hundr yard of this flat
ground at it base belong to the english and then extend across the
strip from the atlant to the mediterranean a distanc of a quarter of
a mile come the neutral ground  a space two or three hundr yard
wide which is free to both parti

are you go through spain to pari  that question was bandi about
the ship day and night from fayal to gibraltar and i thought i never
could get so tire of hear ani one combin of word again or more
tire of answer i dont know  at the last moment six or seven had
suffici decis of charact to make up their mind to go and did
go and i felt a sens of relief at onceit was forev too late now and
i could make up my mind at my leisur not to go i must have a
prodigi quantiti of mind it take me as much as a week sometim to
make it up

but behold how annoy repeat themselv we had no sooner gotten rid
of the spain distress than the gibraltar guid start anothera
tiresom repetit of a legend that had noth veri astonish about
it even in the first place that high hill yonder is call the queen
chair it is becaus one of the queen of spain place her chair there
when the french and spanish troop were besieg gibraltar and said she
would never move from the spot till the english flag was lower from the
fortress if the english hadnt been gallant enough to lower the flag
for a few hour one day shed have had to break her oath or die up
there 

we rode on ass and mule up the steep narrow street and enter the
subterranean galleri the english have blast out in the rock these
galleri are like spacious railway tunnel and at short interv in
them great gun frown out upon sea and town through porthol five or six
hundr feet abov the ocean there is a mile or so of this subterranean
work and it must have cost a vast deal of money and labor the galleri
gun command the peninsula and the harbor of both ocean but they might
as well not be there i should think for an armi could hard climb the
perpendicular wall of the rock anyhow those lofti porthol afford
superb view of the sea though at one place where a jut crag was
hollow out into a great chamber whose furnitur was huge cannon and
whose window were porthol a glimps was caught of a hill not far
away and a soldier said

that high hill yonder is call the queen chair it is becaus a queen
of spain place her chair there onc when the french and spanish troop
were besieg gibraltar and said she would never move from the spot
till the english flag was lower from the fortress if the english
hadnt been gallant enough to lower the flag for a few hour one day
shed have had to break her oath or die up there 

on the topmost pinnacl of gibraltar we halt a good while and no doubt
the mule were tire they had a right to be the militari road was
good but rather steep and there was a good deal of it the view from
the narrow ledg was magnific from it vessel seem like the
tiniest littl toy boat were turn into nobl ship by the telescop
and other vessel that were fifti mile away and even sixti they said
and invis to the nake eye could be clear distinguish through
those same telescop below on one side we look down upon an
endless mass of batteri and on the other straight down to the sea

while i was rest ever so comfort on a rampart and cool my
bake head in the delici breez an offici guid belong to
anoth parti came up and said

senor that high hill yonder is call the queen chair

sir i am a helpless orphan in a foreign land have piti on me dont
now dont inflict that most infern old legend on me anymor today 

therei had use strong languag after promis i would never do so
again but the provoc was more than human natur could bear if you
had been bore so when you had the nobl panorama of spain and africa
and the blue mediterranean spread abroad at your feet and want to gaze
and enjoy and surfeit yourself in it beauti in silenc you might have
even burst into stronger languag than i did

gibraltar has stood sever protract sieg one of them of near four
year durat it fail and the english onli captur it by
stratagem the wonder is that anybodi should ever dream of tri so
imposs a project as the take it by assaultand yet it has been
tri more than onc

the moor held the place twelv hundr year ago and a staunch old
castl of their of that date still frown from the middl of the town
with mossgrown battlement and side well scar by shot fire in
battl and sieg that are forgotten now a secret chamber in the rock
behind it was discov some time ago which contain a sword of
exquisit workmanship and some quaint old armor of a fashion that
antiquari are not acquaint with though it is suppos to be roman
roman armor and roman relic of various kind have been found in a cave
in the sea extrem of gibraltar histori say rome held this part of
the countri about the christian era and these thing seem to confirm the
statement

in that cave also are found human bone crust with a veri thick stoni
coat and wise men have ventur to say that those men not onli live
befor the flood but as much as ten thousand year befor it it may be
trueit look reason enoughbut as long as those parti cant vote
anymor the matter can be of no great public interest in this cave
likewis are found skeleton and fossil of anim that exist in everi
part of africa yet within memori and tradit have never exist in ani
portion of spain save this lone peak of gibraltar so the theori is that
the channel between gibraltar and africa was onc dri land and that the
low neutral neck between gibraltar and the spanish hill behind it was
onc ocean and of cours that these african anim be over at
gibraltar after rock perhapsther is plenti there got close out
when the great chang occur the hill in africa across the channel
are full of ape and there are now and alway have been ape on the rock
of gibraltarbut not elsewher in spain the subject is an interest
one

there is an english garrison at gibraltar of   or   men and so
uniform of flame red are plenti and red and blue and undress
costum of snowi white and also the queer uniform of the barekne
highland and one see softey spanish girl from san roqu and
veil moorish beauti i suppos they are beauti from tarifa and
turban sash and trouser moorish merchant from fez and
longrob bareleg rag muhammadan vagabond from tetuan and
tangier some brown some yellow and some as black as virgin inkand
jew from all around in gabardin skullcap and slipper just as they
are in pictur and theater and just as they were three thousand year
ago no doubt you can easili understand that a tribe somehow our
pilgrim suggest that express becaus they march in a straggl
process through these foreign place with such an indianlik air of
complac and independ about them like our made up from fifteen
or sixteen state of the union found enough to stare at in this
shift panorama of fashion today

speak of our pilgrim remind me that we have one or two peopl among
us who are sometim an annoy howev i do not count the oracl in
that list i will explain that the oracl is an innoc old ass who
eat for four and look wiser than the whole academi of franc would have
ani right to look and never use a onesyl word when he can think
of a longer one and never by ani possibl chanc know the mean of
ani long word he use or ever get it in the right place yet he will
seren ventur an opinion on the most abstrus subject and back it up
complac with quotat from author who never exist and final
when corner will slide to the other side of the question say he has
been there all the time and come back at you with your own spoken
argument onli with the big word all tangl and play them in your
veri teeth as origin with himself he read a chapter in the
guidebook mix the fact all up with his bad memori and then goe
off to inflict the whole mess on somebodi as wisdom which has been
fester in his brain for year and which he gather in colleg from
erudit author who are dead now and out of print this morn at
breakfast he point out of the window and said

do you see that there hill out there on that african coast it one of
them pillow of herkewl i should sayand there the ultim one
alongsid of it 

the ultim onethat is a good wordbut the pillar are not both on
the same side of the strait  i saw he had been deceiv by a
careless written sentenc in the guidebook

well it aint for you to say nor for me some author state it that
way and some state it differ old gibbon dont say noth about
itjust shirk it completegibbon alway done that when he got stuck
but there is rolampton what doe he say whi he say that they was
both on the same side and trinculian and sobast and syraccus and
langomarganbl

oh that will dothat enough if you have got your hand in for
invent author and testimoni i have noth more to saylet them be
on the same side 

we dont mind the oracl we rather like him we can toler the
oracl veri easili but we have a poet and a goodnatur enterpris
idiot on board and they do distress the compani the one give copi
of his vers to consul command hotel keeper arab dutchto
anybodi in fact who will submit to a grievous inflict most kind
meant his poetri is all veri well on shipboard notwithstand when he
wrote an ode to the ocean in a storm in one half hour and an
apostroph to the rooster in the waist of the ship in the next the
transit was consid to be rather abrupt but when he send an
invoic of rhyme to the governor of fayal and anoth to the command
in chief and other dignitari in gibraltar with the compliment of the
laureat of the ship it is not popular with the passeng

the other personag i have mention is young and green and not bright
not learn and not wise he will be though someday if he recollect
the answer to all his question he is known about the ship as the
interrog point  and this by constant use has becom shorten to
interrog  he has distinguish himself twice alreadi in fayal
they point out a hill and told him it was  feet high and   feet
long and they told him there was a tunnel   feet long and  
feet high run through the hill from end to end he believ it he
repeat it to everybodi discuss it and read it from his note
final he took a use hint from this remark which a thought old
pilgrim made

well yes it is a littl remarkablesingular tunnel altogetherstand
up out of the top of the hill about two hundr feet and one end of it
stick out of the hill about nine hundr 

here in gibraltar he corner these educ british offic and badger
them with braggadocio about america and the wonder she can perform he
told one of them a coupl of our gunboat could come here and knock
gibraltar into the mediterranean sea

at this present moment half a dozen of us are take a privat pleasur
excurs of our own devis we form rather more than half the list of
white passeng on board a small steamer bound for the vener moorish
town of tangier africa noth could be more absolut certain than
that we are enjoy ourselv one can not do otherwis who speed over
these sparkl water and breath the soft atmospher of this sunni
land care cannot assail us here we are out of it jurisdict

we even steam reckless by the frown fortress of malabat
a stronghold of the emperor of morocco without a twing of fear
the whole garrison turn out under arm and assum a threaten
attitudeyet still we did not fear the entir garrison march and
countermarch within the rampart in full viewyet notwithstand
even this we never flinch

i suppos we realli do not know what fear is i inquir the name of the
garrison of the fortress of malabat and they said it was mehemet ali ben
sancom i said it would be a good idea to get some more garrison to
help him but they said no he had noth to do but hold the place and
he was compet to do that had done it two year alreadi that was
evid which one could not well refut there is noth like
reput

everi now and then my glove purchas in gibraltar last night intrud
itself upon me dan and the ship surgeon and i had been up to the
great squar listen to the music of the fine militari band and
contempl english and spanish femal loveli and fashion and at
nine oclock were on our way to the theater when we met the general the
judg the commodor the colonel and the commission of the unit
state of america to europ asia and africa who had been to the club
hous to regist their sever titl and impoverish the bill of fare
and they told us to go over to the littl varieti store near the hall of
justic and buy some kid glove they said they were eleg and veri
moder in price it seem a stylish thing to go to the theater in kid
glove and we act upon the hint a veri handsom young ladi in the
store offer me a pair of blue glove i did not want blue but she
said they would look veri pretti on a hand like mine the remark touch
me tender i glanc furtiv at my hand and somehow it did seem
rather a come member i tri a glove on my left and blush a littl
manifest the size was too small for me but i felt gratifi when she
said

oh it is just right  yet i knew it was no such thing

i tug at it dilig but it was discourag work she said

ah i see you are accustom to wear kid glovesbut some gentlemen
are so awkward about put them on 

it was the last compliment i had expect i onli understand put on
the buckskin articl perfect i made anoth effort and tore the glove
from the base of the thumb into the palm of the handand tri to hide
the rent she kept up her compliment and i kept up my determin to
deserv them or die

ah you have had experi a rip down the back of the hand  they
are just right for youyour hand is veri smallif they tear you need
not pay for them a rent across the middl  i can alway tell when a
gentleman understand put on kid glove there is a grace about it
that onli come with long practic  the whole afterguard of the glove
fetch away  as the sailor say the fabric part across the
knuckl and noth was left but a melancholi ruin

i was too much flatter to make an exposur and throw the merchandis on
the angel hand i was hot vex confus but still happi but i
hate the other boy for take such an absorb interest in the
proceed i wish they were in jericho i felt exquisit mean
when i said cheer

this one doe veri well it fit eleg i like a glove that fit
no never mind maam never mind ill put the other on in the street
it is warm here 

it was warm it was the warmest place i ever was in i paid the bill
and as i pass out with a fascin bow i thought i detect a light
in the woman eye that was gentl iron and when i look back from
the street and she was laugh all to herself about someth or other
i said to myself with wither sarcasm oh certain you know how to
put on kid glove dont you a selfcomplac ass readi to be
flatter out of your sens by everi petticoat that choos to take the
troubl to do it 

the silenc of the boy annoy me final dan said muse

some gentlemen dont know how to put on kid glove at all but some do 

and the doctor said to the moon i thought

but it is alway easi to tell when a gentleman is use to put on kid
glove 

dan soliloqu after a paus

ah yes there is a grace about it that onli come with long veri long
practic

was drag a cat out of an ash hole by the tail he understand put
on kid glove he had ex

boy enough of a thing enough you think you are veri smart i
suppos but i dont and if you go and tell ani of those old gossip in
the ship about this thing ill never forgiv you for it that all

alon in time to prevent ill feel from spoil a joke but they had
bought glove too as i did we threw all the purchas away togeth
this morn they were coars unsubstanti freckl all over with
broad yellow splotch and could neither stand wear nor public
exhibit we had entertain an angel unawar but we did not take

the middl of it from side to sideth selfsam fashion their tangier
ancestor have worn for i dont know how mani bewild centuri
their feet and ankl are bare their nose are all hook and hook
alik they all resembl each other so much that one could almost
believ they were of one famili their women are plump and pretti and
do smile upon a christian in a way which is in the last degre
comfort

what a funni old town it is it seem like profan to laugh and jest
and bandi the frivol chat of our day amid it hoari relic onli the
state phraseolog and the measur speech of the son of the prophet
are suit to a vener antiqu like this here is a crumbl wall
that was old when columbus discov america was old when peter the
hermit rous the knight men of the middl age to arm for the first
crusad was old when charlemagn and his paladin beleagu enchant
castl and battl with giant and genii in the fabl day of the olden
time was old when christ and his discipl walk the earth stood where
it stand today when the lip of memnon were vocal and men bought and
sold in the street of ancient thebe

the phoenician the carthagenian the english moor roman all have
battl for tangieral have won it and lost it here is a rag
orientallook negro from some desert place in interior africa fill
his goatskin with water from a stain and batter fountain built by the
roman twelv hundr year ago yonder is a ruin arch of a bridg
built by julius caesar nineteen hundr year ago men who had seen the
infant saviour in the virgin arm have stood upon it mayb

near it are the ruin of a dockyard where caesar repair his ship and
load them with grain when he invad britain fifti year befor the
christian era

here under the quiet star these old street seem throng with the
phantom of forgotten age my eye are rest upon a spot where stood
a monument which was seen and describ by roman historian less than two
thousand year ago whereon was inscrib

we are the canaanit we are they that
have been driven out of the land of canaan
by the jewish robber joshua 

joshua drove them out and they came here not mani leagu from here is
a tribe of jew whose ancestor fled thither after an unsuccess revolt
against king david and these their descend are still under a ban and
keep to themselv

tangier has been mention in histori for three thousand year and it
was a town though a queer one when hercul clad in his lion skin
land here four thousand year ago in these street he met anitus
the king of the countri and brain him with his club which was the
fashion among gentlemen in those day the peopl of tangier call
tingi then live in the rudest possibl hut and dress in skin and
carri club and were as savag as the wild beast they were constant
oblig to war with but they were a gentleman race and did no work
they live on the natur product of the land their king countri
resid was at the famous garden of hesperid seventi mile down the
coast from here the garden with it golden appl orang is gone
nowno vestig of it remain antiquarian conced that such a
personag as hercul did exist in ancient time and agre that he was an
enterpris and energet man but declin to believ him a good
bonafid god becaus that would be unconstitut

down here at cape spartel is the celebr cave of hercul where that
hero took refug when he was vanquish and driven out of the tangier
countri it is full of inscript in the dead languag which fact
make me think hercul could not have travel much els he would not
have kept a journal

five day journey from heresay two hundr milesar the ruin of an
ancient citi of whose histori there is neither record nor tradit
and yet it arch it column and it statu proclaim it to have been
built by an enlighten race

the general size of a store in tangier is about that of an ordinari
shower bath in a civil land the muhammadan merchant tinman
shoemak or vendor of trifl sit crossleg on the floor and
reach after ani articl you may want to buy you can rent a whole
block of these pigeonhol for fifti dollar a month the market peopl
crowd the marketplac with their basket of fig date melon
apricot etc and among them file train of laden ass not much
larger if ani than a newfoundland dog the scene is live is
picturesqu and smell like a polic court the jewish moneychang
have their den close at hand and all day long are count bronz coin
and transfer them from one bushel basket to anoth they dont coin
much money nowaday i think i saw none but what was date four or five
hundr year back and was bad worn and batter these coin are not
veri valuabl jack went out to get a napoleon chang so as to have
money suit to the general cheap of thing and came back and said
he had swamp the bank had bought eleven quart of coin and the head
of the firm had gone on the street to negoti for the balanc of the
chang  i bought near half a pint of their money for a shill
myself i am not proud on account of have so much money though i
care noth for wealth

the moor have some small silver coin and also some silver slug worth a
dollar each the latter are exceed scarceso much so that when
poor rag arab see one they beg to be allow to kiss it

they have also a small gold coin worth two dollar and that remind me
of someth when morocco is in a state of war arab courier carri
letter through the countri and charg a liber postag everi now and
then they fall into the hand of maraud band and get rob
therefor warn by experi as soon as they have collect two
dollar worth of money they exchang it for one of those littl gold
piec and when robber come upon them swallow it the stratagem was
good while it was unsuspect but after that the maraud simpli gave
the sagaci unit state mail an emet and sat down to wait

the emperor of morocco is a soulless despot and the great offic under
him are despot on a smaller scale there is no regular system of
taxat but when the emperor or the bashaw want money they levi on
some rich man and he has to furnish the cash or go to prison
therefor few men in morocco dare to be rich it is too danger a
luxuri vaniti occasion lead a man to display wealth but sooner or
later the emperor trump up a charg against himani sort of one will
doand confisc his properti of cours there are mani rich men in
the empir but their money is buri and they dress in rag and
counterfeit poverti everi now and then the emperor imprison a man who
is suspect of the crime of be rich and make thing so
uncomfort for him that he is forc to discov where he has hidden
his money

moor and jew sometim place themselv under the protect of the
foreign consul and then they can flout their rich in the emperor
face with impun




chapter ix

about the first adventur we had yesterday afternoon after land here
came near finish that heedless blucher we had just mount some
mule and ass and start out under the guardianship of the state
the princ the magnific hadji muhammad lamarti may his tribe
increas when we came upon a fine moorish mosqu with tall tower rich
with checkerwork of manycolor porcelain and everi part and portion
of the edific adorn with the quaint architectur of the alhambra and
blucher start to ride into the open doorway a startl hihi  from
our camp follow and a loud halt  from an english gentleman in the
parti check the adventur and then we were inform that so dire a
profan is it for a christian dog to set foot upon the sacr
threshold of a moorish mosqu that no amount of purif can ever
make it fit for the faith to pray in again had blucher succeed in
enter the place he would no doubt have been chase through the town
and stone and the time has been and not mani year ago either when a
christian would have been most ruthless slaughter if captur in a
mosqu we caught a glimps of the handsom tessel pavement within
and of the devote perform their ablut at the fountain but even
that we took that glimps was a thing not relish by the moorish
bystand

some year ago the clock in the tower of the mosqu got out of order
the moor of tangier have so degener that it has been long sinc
there was an artific among them capabl of cure so delic a patient
as a debilit clock the great men of the citi met in solemn conclav
to consid how the difficulti was to be met they discuss the matter
thorough but arriv at no solut final a patriarch aros and
said

oh children of the prophet it is known unto you that a portugue dog
of a christian clock mender pollut the citi of tangier with his
presenc ye know also that when mosqu are build ass bear the
stone and the cement and cross the sacr threshold now therefor
send the christian dog on all four and barefoot into the holi place to
mend the clock and let him go as an ass 

and in that way it was done therefor if blucher ever see the insid
of a mosqu he will have to cast asid his human and go in his
natur charact we visit the jail and found moorish prison
make mat and basket this thing of util crime savor of
civil murder is punish with death a short time ago three
murder were taken beyond the citi wall and shot moorish gun are
not good and neither are moorish marksmen in this instanc they set up
the poor crimin at long rang like so mani target and practic on
themkept them hop about and dodg bullet for half an hour befor
they manag to drive the center

when a man steal cattl they cut off his right hand and left leg and
nail them up in the marketplac as a warn to everybodi their surgeri
is not artist they slice around the bone a littl then break off the
limb sometim the patient get well but as a general thing he
dont howev the moorish heart is stout the moor were alway
brave these crimin undergo the fear oper without a winc
without a tremor of ani kind without a groan no amount of suffer
can bring down the pride of a moor or make him shame his digniti with a
cri

here marriag is contract by the parent of the parti to it there
are no valentin no stolen interview no ride out no court in
dim parlor no lover quarrel and reconciliationsno noth that is
proper to approach matrimoni the young man take the girl his father
select for him marri her and after that she is unveil and he see
her for the first time if after due acquaint she suit him he
retain her but if he suspect her puriti he bundl her back to her
father if he find her diseas the same or if after just and
reason time is allow her she neglect to bear children back she
goe to the home of her childhood

muhammadan here who can afford it keep a good mani wive on hand they
are call wive though i believ the koran onli allow four genuin
wivesth rest are concubin the emperor of morocco dont know how
mani wive he has but think he has five hundr howev that is near
enougha dozen or so one way or the other dont matter

even the jew in the interior have a plural of wive

i have caught a glimps of the face of sever moorish women for they
are onli human and will expos their face for the admir of a
christian dog when no male moor is by and i am full of vener for
the wisdom that lead them to cover up such atroci ugli

they carri their children at their back in a sack like other savag
the world over

mani of the negro are held in slaveri by the moor but the moment a
femal slave becom her master concubin her bond are broken and as
soon as a male slave can read the first chapter of the koran which
contain the creed he can no longer be held in bondag

they have three sunday a week in tangier the muhammadan come on
friday the jew on saturday and that of the christian consul on
sunday the jew are the most radic the moor goe to his mosqu
about noon on his sabbath as on ani other day remov his shoe at the
door perform his ablut make his salaam press his forehead to
the pavement time and again say his prayer and goe back to his work

but the jew shut up shop will not touch copper or bronz money at all
soil his finger with noth meaner than silver and gold attend the
synagogu devout will not cook or have anyth to do with fire and
religi refrain from embark in ani enterpris

the moor who has made a pilgrimag to mecca is entitl to high
distinct men call him hadji and he is thenceforward a great
personag hundr of moor come to tangier everi year and embark for
mecca they go part of the way in english steamer and the ten or
twelv dollar they pay for passag is about all the trip cost they
take with them a quantiti of food and when the commissari depart
fail they skirmish  as jack term it in his sin slangi way from
the time they leav till they get home again they never wash either on
land or sea they are usual gone from five to seven month and as
they do not chang their cloth dure all that time they are total
unfit for the draw room when they get back

mani of them have to rake and scrape a long time to gather togeth the
ten dollar their steamer passag cost and when one of them get back
he is a bankrupt forev after few moor can ever build up their
fortun again in one short lifetim after so reckless an outlay in
order to confin the digniti of hadji to gentlemen of patrician blood and
possess the emperor decre that no man should make the pilgrimag
save bloat aristocrat who were worth a hundr dollar in speci but
behold how iniqu can circumv the law for a consider the
jewish moneychang lend the pilgrim one hundr dollar long enough
for him to swear himself through and then receiv it back befor the
ship sail out of the harbor

spain is the onli nation the moor fear the reason is that spain send
her heaviest ship of war and her loudest gun to astonish these muslim
while america and other nation send onli a littl contempt tub of a
gunboat occasion the moor like other savag learn by what they
see not what they hear or read we have great fleet in the
mediterranean but they seldom touch at african port the moor have a
small opinion of england franc and america and put their
repres to a deal of redtap circumlocut befor they grant
them their common right let alon a favor but the moment the spanish
minist make a demand it is acced to at onc whether it be just or
not

spain chastis the moor five or six year ago about a disput piec
of properti opposit gibraltar and captur the citi of tetouan she
compromis on an augment of her territori twenti million dollar
indemn in money and peac and then she gave up the citi but she
never gave it up until the spanish soldier had eaten up all the cat
they would not compromis as long as the cat held out spaniard are
veri fond of cat on the contrari the moor rever cat as
someth sacr so the spaniard touch them on a tender point that
time their unfelin conduct in eat up all the tetouan cat arous a
hatr toward them in the breast of the moor to which even the drive
them out of spain was tame and passionless moor and spaniard are foe
forev now franc had a minist here onc who embitt the nation
against him in the most innoc way he kill a coupl of battalion
of cat tangier is full of them and made a parlor carpet out of their
hide he made his carpet in circlesfirst a circl of old gray
tomcat with their tail all point toward the center then a circl
of yellow cat next a circl of black cat and a circl of white one
then a circl of all sort of cat and final a centerpiec of
assort kitten it was veri beauti but the moor curs his memori
to this day

when we went to call on our american consul general today i notic that
all possibl game for parlor amus seem to be repres on his
center tabl i thought that hint at lonesom the idea was
correct his is the onli american famili in tangier there are mani
foreign consul in this place but much visit is not indulg in
tangier is clear out of the world and what is the use of visit when
peopl have noth on earth to talk about there is none so each
consul famili stay at home chiefli and amus itself as best it can
tangier is full of interest for one day but after that it is a weari
prison the consul general has been here five year and has got enough
of it to do him for a centuri and is go home short his famili
seiz upon their letter and paper when the mail arriv read them over
and over again for two day or three talk them over and over again for
two or three more till they wear them out and after that for day
togeth they eat and drink and sleep and ride out over the same old
road and see the same old tiresom thing that even decad of centuri
have scarc chang and say never a singl word they have liter
noth whatev to talk about the arriv of an american manofwar is
a godsend to them o solitud where are the charm which sage have
seen in thi face  it is the completest exil that i can conceiv of
i would serious recommend to the govern of the unit state that
when a man commit a crime so heinous that the law provid no adequ
punish for it they make him consul general to tangier

i am glad to have seen tangierth secondoldest town in the world but
i am readi to bid it goodby i believ

we shall go henc to gibraltar this even or in the morn and
doubtless the quaker citi will sail from that port within the next
fortyeight hour




chapter x

we pass the fourth of juli on board the quaker citi in midocean it
was in all respect a characterist mediterranean dayfaultless
beauti a cloudless sky a refresh summer wind a radiant sunshin
that glint cheerili from danc wavelet instead of crest mountain
of water a sea beneath us that was so wonder blue so rich
brilliant blue that it overcam the dullest sensibl with the
spell of it fascin

they even have fine sunset on the mediterraneana thing that is
certain rare in most quarter of the globe the even we sail away
from gibraltar that hardfeatur rock was swim in a creami mist so
rich so soft so enchant vagu and dreami that even the oracl
that seren that inspir that overpow humbug scorn the dinner
gong and tarri to worship

he said well that gorgi aint it they dont have none of them
thing in our part do they i consid that them effect is on account
of the superior refrag as you may say of the sun diram
combin with the lymphat forc of the perihelion of jubit what
should you think 

oh go to bed  dan said that and went away

oh yes it all veri well to say go to bed when a man make an
argument which anoth man cant answer dan dont never stand ani
chanc in an argument with me and he know it too what should you
say jack 

now doctor dont you come bother around me with that dictionari
bosh i dont do you ani harm do i then you let me alon 

he gone too well them fellow have all tackl the old oracl as
they say but the old man most too mani for em mayb the poet lariat
aint satisfi with them deduct 

the poet repli with a barbar rhyme and went below

pear that he cant qualifi neither well i didnt expect noth
out of him i never see one of them poet yet that know anyth
hell go down now and grind out about four ream of the awfullest slush
about that old rock and give it to a consul or a pilot or a nigger or
anybodi he come across first which he can impos on piti but
somebodyd take that poor old lunat and dig all that poetri rubbag out
of him whi cant a man put his intellect onto thing that some valu
gibbon and hippocratus and sarcophagus and all them old ancient
philosoph was down on poets

doctor  i said you are go to invent author now and ill leav
you too i alway enjoy your convers notwithstand the
luxuri of your syllabl when the philosophi you offer rest on your
own respons but when you begin to soarwhen you begin to support
it with the evid of author who are the creation of your own
fancyi lose confid 

that was the way to flatter the doctor he consid it a sort of
acknowledg on my part of a fear to argu with him he was alway
persecut the passeng with abstrus proposit frame in languag
that no man could understand and they endur the exquisit tortur a
minut or two and then abandon the field a triumph like this over
half a dozen antagonist was suffici for one day from that time
forward he would patrol the deck beam bland upon all comer and so
tranquilli bliss happi

but i digress the thunder of our two brave cannon announc the fourth
of juli at daylight to all who were awak but mani of us got our
inform at a later hour from the almanac all the flag were sent
aloft except half a dozen that were need to decor portion of the
ship below and in a short time the vessel assum a holiday appear
dure the morn meet were held and all manner of committe set
to work on the celebr ceremoni in the afternoon the ship
compani assembl aft on deck under the awn the flute the
asthmat melodeon and the consumpt clarinet crippl the
starspangl banner  the choir chase it to cover and georg came in
with a peculiar lacer screech on the final note and slaughter
it nobodi mourn

we carri out the corps on three cheer that joke was not intent
and i do not endors it and then the presid throne behind a cabl
locker with a nation flag spread over it announc the reader  who
rose up and read that same old declar of independ which we have
all listen to so often without pay ani attent to what it said
and after that the presid pipe the orat of the day to quarter and
he made that same old speech about our nation great which we so
religi believ and so fervent applaud now came the choir into
court again with the complain instrument and assault hail
columbia and when victori hung waver in the scale georg return
with his dread wildgoos stop turn on and the choir won of cours
a minist pronounc the benedict and the patriot littl gather
disband the fourth of juli was safe as far as the mediterranean was
concern

at dinner in the even a wellwritten origin poem was recit with
spirit by one of the ship captain and thirteen regular toast were
wash down with sever basket of champagn the speech were bad
execr almost without except in fact without ani except but
one captain duncan made a good speech he made the onli good speech of
the even he said

ladi and gentlemen may we all live to a green old age and be
prosper and happi steward bring up anoth basket of champagn 

it was regard as a veri abl effort

the festiv so to speak close with anoth of those miracul
ball on the promenad deck we were not use to danc on an even
keel though and it was onli a question success but take it all
togeth it was a bright cheer pleasant fourth

toward nightfal the next even we steam into the great artifici
harbor of this nobl citi of marseill and saw the die sunlight gild
it cluster spire and rampart and flood it leagu of environ
verdur with a mellow radianc that touch with an ad charm the white
villa that fleck the landscap far and near copyright secur
accord to law 

there were no stage out and we could not get on the pier from the ship
it was annoy we were full of enthusiasmw want to see franc
just at nightfal our parti of three contract with a waterman for the
privileg of use his boat as a bridgeit stern was at our companion
ladder and it bow touch the pier we got in and the fellow back out
into the harbor i told him in french that all we want was to walk
over his thwart and step ashor and ask him what he went away out
there for he said he could not understand me i repeat still he
could not understand he appear to be veri ignor of french the
doctor tri him but he could not understand the doctor i ask this
boatman to explain his conduct which he did and then i couldnt
understand him dan said

we reason calm with dan that it was useless to speak to this
foreign in englishthat he had better let us conduct this busi in
the french languag and not let the stranger see how uncultiv he was

well go on go on  he said dont mind me i dont wish to
interfer onli if you go on tell him in your kind of french he
never will find out where we want to go to that is what i think about
it 

we rebuk him sever for this remark and said we never knew an
ignor person yet but was prejud the frenchman spoke again and
the doctor said

there now dan he say he is go to allez to the douain mean he is
go to the hotel oh certainlyw dont know the french languag 

this was a crusher as jack would say it silenc further critic
from the disaffect member we coast past the sharp bow of a navi of
great steamship and stop at last at a govern build on a stone
pier it was easi to rememb then that the douain was the customhous
and not the hotel we did not mention it howev with win french

we said it was a low disreput falsehood but we knew it was not
it was plain that it would not do to pass that drugstor again though
we might go on ask direct but we must ceas from follow
fingerpoint if we hope to check the suspicion of the disaffect
member

we have come five hundr mile by rail through the heart of franc
what a bewitch land it is what a garden sure the leagu of
bright green lawn are swept and brush and water everi day and their
grass trim by the barber sure the hedg are shape and measur
and their symmetri preserv by the most architectur of garden
sure the long straight row of state poplar that divid the
beauti landscap like the squar of a checkerboard are set with line

sure the straight smooth pure white turnpik are jackplan and
sandpap everi day how els are these marvel of symmetri
cleanli and order attain it is wonder there are no
unsight stone wall and never a fenc of ani kind there is no dirt
no decay no rubbish anywherenoth that even hint at untidi
noth that ever suggest neglect all is order and beautifuleveri
thing is charm to the eye

we had such glimps of the rhone glide along between it grassi bank

villag with mossi mediev cathedr loom out of their midst of
wood hill with ivygrown tower and turret of feudal castl
project abov the foliag such glimps of paradis it seem to us
such vision of fabl fairyland

we knew then what the poet meant when he sang of thi cornfield
green and sunni vine o pleasant land of franc 

and it is a pleasant land no word describ it so felicit as that
one they say there is no word for home in the french languag well
consid that they have the articl itself in such an attract
aspect they ought to manag to get along without the word let us not
wast too much piti on homeless franc i have observ that frenchmen
abroad seldom wholli give up the idea of go back to franc some time
or other i am not surpris at it now

we are not infatu with these french railway car though we took
firstclass passag not becaus we wish to attract attent by do
a thing which is uncommon in europ but becaus we could make our journey
quicker by so do it is hard to make railroad pleasant in ani
countri it is too tedious stagecoach is infinit more
delight onc i cross the plain and desert and mountain of the
west in a stagecoach from the missouri line to california and sinc
then all my pleasur trip must be measur to that rare holiday frolic
two thousand mile of ceaseless rush and rattl and clatter by night and
by day and never a weari moment never a laps of interest the first
seven hundr mile a level contin it grassi carpet greener and
softer and smoother than ani sea and figur with design fit to it

morn befor the sun was fair up it was worth a lifetim of citi
toil and moil to perch in the foretop with the driver and see the
six mustang scamper under the sharp snap of the whip that never
touch them to scan the blue distanc of a world that knew no lord
but us to cleav the wind with uncov head and feel the sluggish
puls rous to the spirit of a speed that pretend to the resistless
rush of a typhoon then thirteen hundr mile of desert solitud of
limitless panorama of bewild perspect of mimic citi of
pinnacl cathedr of massiv fortress counterfeit in the etern
rock and splendid with the crimson and gold of the set sun of dizzi
altitud among fogwreath peak and nevermelt snow where
thunder and lightn and tempest war magnific at our feet and
the storm cloud abov swung their shred banner in our veri face
but i forgot i am in eleg franc now and not scurri through the
great south pass and the wind river mountain among antelop and
buffalo and paint indian on the warpath it is not meet that i
should make too disparag comparison between humdrum travel on a
railway and that royal summer flight across a contin in a stagecoach
i meant in the begin to say that railway journey is tedious and
tiresom and so it isthough at the time i was think particular of
a dismal fiftyhour pilgrimag between new york and st loui of cours
our trip through franc was not realli tedious becaus all it scene and
experi were new and strang but as dan say it had it
discrep 

the car are built in compart that hold eight person each each
compart is partial subdivid and so there are two toler
distinct parti of four in it four face the other four the seat and
back are thick pad and cushion and are veri comfort you can
smoke if you wish there are no bothersom peddler you are save the
inflict of a multitud of disagre fellow passeng so far so
well but then the conductor lock you in when the train start there
is no water to drink in the car there is no heat apparatus for night
travel if a drunken rowdi should get in you could not remov a matter
of twenti seat from him or enter anoth car but abov all if you are
worn out and must sleep you must sit up and do it in nap with cramp
leg and in a tortur miseri that leav you wither and lifeless the
next dayfor behold they have not that culmin of all chariti and
human kind a sleep car in all franc i prefer the american
system it has not so mani grievous discrep

brakeman he is readi and perfect will to answer all your question
with tireless polit readi to tell you which car to take yea and
readi to go and put you into it to make sure that you shall not go

not start till your ticket has been examinedtil everi passeng

and then along the rout and when it is time to chang car you will
know it you are in the hand of offici who zealous studi your

they say they do not have accid on these french road and i think it
must be true if i rememb right we pass high abov wagon road or
through tunnel under them but never cross them on their own level
about everi quarter of a mile it seem to me a man came out and held
up a club till the train went by to signifi that everyth was safe
ahead switch were chang a mile in advanc by pull a wire rope
that pass along the ground by the rail from station to station
signal for the day and signal for the night gave constant and time

no they have no railroad accid to speak of in franc but whi
becaus when one occur somebodi has to hang for it not hang mayb

neglig a thing to be shudder at by railroad offici for mani a

the old travelersthos delight parrot who have been here before
and know more about the countri than loui napoleon know now or ever
will knowtel us these thing and we believ them becaus they are
pleasant thing to believ and becaus they are plausibl and savor of
the rigid subject to law and order which we behold about us
everywher

but we love the old travel we love to hear them prate and drivel and
lie we can tell them the moment we see them they alway throw out a
few feeler they never cast themselv adrift till they have sound
everi individu and know that he has not travel then they open their

and blasphem the sacr name of truth their central idea their grand
aim is to subjug you keep you down make you feel insignific and
humbl in the blaze of their cosmopolitan glori they will not let you
know anyth they sneer at your most inoffens suggest they
laugh unfeel at your treasur dream of foreign land they brand
the statement of your travel aunt and uncl as the stupidest
absurd they derid your most trust author and demolish the fair

through it and then excit delight and half persuad that we were
onli the sport of a beauti dream lo we stood in magnific pari

what excel order they kept about that vast depot there was no
frantic crowd and jostl no shout and swear and no
swagger intrus of servic by rowdi hackmen these latter gentri
stood outsidestood quiet by their long line of vehicl and said
never a word a kind of hackman general seem to have the whole matter
of transport in his hand he polit receiv the passeng and
usher them to the kind of convey they want and told the driver
where to deliv them there was no talk back  no dissatisfact
about overcharg no grumbl about anyth in a littl while we
were speed through the street of pari and delight recogn
certain name and place with which book had long ago made us familiar
it was like meet an old friend when we read rue de rivoli on the
street corner we knew the genuin vast palac of the louvr as well as
we knew it pictur when we pass by the column of juli we need no
one to tell us what it was or to remind us that on it site onc stood
the grim bastill that grave of human hope and happi that dismal
prison hous within whose dungeon so mani young face put on the
wrinkl of age so mani proud spirit grew humbl so mani brave heart
broke

we secur room at the hotel or rather we had three bed put into one
room so that we might be togeth and then we went out to a restaur
just after lamplight and ate a comfort satisfactori linger
dinner it was a pleasur to eat where everyth was so tidi the food
so well cook the waiter so polit and the come and depart
compani so moustach so friski so affabl so fear and
wonder frenchi all the surround were gay and enliven two
hundr peopl sat at littl tabl on the sidewalk sip wine and
coffe the street were throng with light vehicl and with joyous
pleasureseek there was music in the air life and action all about
us and a conflagr of gaslight everywher

after dinner we felt like see such parisian specialti as we might
see without distress exert and so we saunter through the
brilliant street and look at the dainti trifl in varieti store and
jewelri shop occasion mere for the pleasur of be cruel we
put unoffend frenchmen on the rack with question frame in the
incomprehens jargon of their nativ languag and while they writh
we impal them we pepper them we scarifi them with their own vile
verb and participl

we notic that in the jewelri store they had some of the articl
mark gold and some label imit  we wonder at this
extravag of honesti and inquir into the matter we were inform
that inasmuch as most peopl are not abl to tell fals gold from the
genuin articl the govern compel jewel to have their gold work
assay and stamp offici accord to it fine and their
imit work duli label with the sign of it falsiti they told us
the jewel would not dare to violat this law and that whatev a
stranger bought in one of their store might be depend upon as be
strict what it was repres to be verili a wonder land is
franc

then we hunt for a barbershop from earliest infanc it had been
a cherish ambit of mine to be shave some day in a palati
barbershop in pari i wish to reclin at full length in a cushion
invalid chair with pictur about me and sumptuous furnitur with
fresco wall and gild arch abov me and vista of corinthian
column stretch far befor me with perfum of arabi to intox
my sens and the slumbrous drone of distant nois to sooth me to
sleep at the end of an hour i would wake up regret and find my
face as smooth and as soft as an infant depart i would lift my
hand abov that barber head and say heaven bless you my son 

so we search high and low for a matter of two hour but never a
barbershop could we see we saw onli wigmak establish with
shock of dead and repuls hair bound upon the head of paint waxen
brigand who stare out from glass box upon the passerbi with their
stoni eye and scare him with the ghost white of their counten
we shun these sign for a time but final we conclud that the
wigmak must of necess be the barber as well sinc we could find
no singl legitim repres of the fratern we enter and
ask and found that it was even so

i said i want to be shave the barber inquir where my room was i
said never mind where my room was i want to be shavedther on the
spot the doctor said he would be shave also then there was an
excit among those two barber there was a wild consult and
afterward a hurri to and fro and a feverish gather up of razor
from obscur place and a ransack for soap next they took us into a
littl mean shabbi back room they got two ordinari sittingroom chair
and place us in them with our coat on my old old dream of bliss
vanish into thin air

i sat bolt upright silent sad and solemn one of the wigmak
villain lather my face for ten terribl minut and finish by
plaster a mass of sud into my mouth i expel the nasti stuff with
a strong english explet and said foreign bewar  then this
outlaw strap his razor on his boot hover over me omin for six
fear second and then swoop down upon me like the genius of
destruct the first rake of his razor loosen the veri hide from my
face and lift me out of the chair i storm and rave and the other
boy enjoy it their beard are not strong and thick let us draw the
curtain over this harrow scene

suffic it that i submit and went through with the cruel inflict of
a shave by a french barber tear of exquisit agoni cours down my
cheek now and then but i surviv then the incipi assassin held a
basin of water under my chin and slop it content over my face and
into my bosom and down the back of my neck with a mean pretens of
wash away the soap and blood he dri my featur with a towel and
was go to comb my hair but i ask to be excus i said with
wither ironi that it was suffici to be skinnedi declin to be
scalp

i went away from there with my handkerchief about my face and never
never never desir to dream of palati parisian barbershop anymor
the truth is as i believ i have sinc found out that they have no
barber shop worthi of the name in parisand no barber either for
that matter the impostor who doe duti as a barber bring his pan and
napkin and implement of tortur to your resid and deliber
skin you in your privat apart ah i have suffer suffer
suffer here in pari but never mindth time is come when i shall
have a dark and bloodi reveng someday a parisian barber will come to
my room to skin me and from that day forth that barber will never be
heard of more

at eleven oclock we alight upon a sign which manifest refer to
billiard joy we had play billiard in the azor with ball that
were not round and on an ancient tabl that was veri littl smoother than
a brick pavementon of those wretch old thing with dead cushion
and with patch in the fade cloth and invis obstruct that made
the ball describ the most astonish and unsuspect angl and
perform feat in the way of unlookedfor and almost imposs
scratches that were perfect bewild we had play at gibraltar
with ball the size of a walnut on a tabl like a public squareand in
both instanc we achiev far more aggrav than amus we
expect to fare better here but we were mistaken the cushion were a
good deal higher than the ball and as the ball had a fashion of alway
stop under the cushion we accomplish veri littl in the way of
carom the cushion were hard and unelast and the cue were so
crook that in make a shot you had to allow for the curv or you would
infal put the english on the wrong side of the hall dan was to
mark while the doctor and i play at the end of an hour neither of us
had made a count and so dan was tire of keep talli with noth to
talli and we were heat and angri and disgust we paid the heavi
billabout six centsand said we would call around sometim when we had
a week to spend and finish the game

we adjourn to one of those pretti cafe and took supper and test the
wine of the countri as we had been instruct to do and found them
harmless and unexcit they might have been excit howev if we
had chosen to drink a suffici of them

to close our first day in pari cheer and pleasant we now sought
our grand room in the grand hotel du louvr and climb into our
sumptuous bed to read and smokebut ala

it was piti
in a whole cityful
gas we had none

no gas to read bynoth but dismal candl it was a shame we tri
to map out excurs for the morrow we puzzl over french guid to
paris we talk disjoint in a vain endeavor to make head or tail of
the wild chao of the day sight and experi we subsid to
indol smoke we gape and yawn and stretchedthen feebli wonder
if we were realli and truli in renown pari and drift drowsili away
into that vast mysteri void which men call sleep




chapter xiii

the next morn we were up and dress at ten oclock we went to the
commissionair of the hoteli dont know what a commissionair is
but that is the man we went toand told him we want a guid he said
the nation exposit had drawn such multitud of englishmen and
american to pari that it would be next to imposs to find a good
guid unemploy he said he usual kept a dozen or two on hand but he
onli had three now he call them one look so like a veri pirat
that we let him go at onc the next one spoke with a simper
precis of pronunci that was irrit and said

if ze zhentleman will to me make ze grand honneur to me rattain in
hee serveec i shall show to him everi sing zat is magnifiqu to look
upon in ze beauti parre i speaki ze angleesh pairfaitemaw 

he would have done well to have stop there becaus he had that much
by heart and said it right off without make a mistak but his
selfcomplac seduc him into attempt a flight into region of
unexplor english and the reckless experi was his ruin within ten
second he was so tangl up in a maze of mutil verb and torn and
bleed form of speech that no human ingenu could ever have gotten
him out of it with credit it was plain enough that he could not
speaky the english quit as pairfaitemaw as he had pretend he
could

the third man captur us he was plain dress but he had a
notic air of neat about him he wore a high silk hat which was
a littl old but had been care brush he wore secondhand kid
glove in good repair and carri a small rattan cane with a curv
handlea femal legof ivori he step as gentl and as daintili as
a cat cross a muddi street and oh he was urban he was quiet

the treacher miscreant after four breakfast and a gallon of
champagn to serv us such a scurvi trick we got no sight of the
countless treasur of art in the louvr galleri that day and our onli
poor littl satisfact was in the reflect that ferguson sold not a
solitari silk dress pattern

i am write this chapter part for the satisfact of abus that
accomplish knave billfing and part to show whosoev shall read
this how american fare at the hand of the pari guid and what sort of
peopl pari guid are it need not be suppos that we were a stupid
or an easier prey than our countrymen general are for we were not
the guid deceiv and defraud everi american who goe to pari for the
first time and see it sight alon or in compani with other as littl
experienc as himself i shall visit pari again someday and then let
the guid bewar i shall go in my war painti shall carri my tomahawk
along

i think we have lost but littl time in pari we have gone to bed everi
night tire out of cours we visit the renown intern
exposit all the world did that we went there on our third day in
parisand we stay there near two hour that was our first and last
visit to tell the truth we saw at a glanc that one would have to
spend weeksyea even monthsin that monstrous establish to get an
intellig idea of it it was a wonder show but the move mass
of peopl of all nation we saw there were a still more wonder show
i discov that if i were to stay there a month i should still find
myself look at the peopl instead of the inanim object on
exhibit i got a littl interest in some curious old tapestri of
the thirteenth centuri but a parti of arab came by and their duski
face and quaint costum call my attent away at onc i watch a
silver swan which had a live grace about his movement and a live
intellig in his eyeswatch him swim about as comfort and
as unconcern as if he had been born in a morass instead of a
jewel shopwatch him seiz a silver fish from under the water and
hold up his head and go through all the customari and elabor motion
of swallow itbut the moment it disappear down his throat some
tattoo south sea island approach and i yield to their
attract

present i found a revolv pistol sever hundr year old which
look strang like a modern colt but just then i heard that the
empress of the french was in anoth part of the build and hasten
away to see what she might look like we heard martial musicw saw an
unusu number of soldier walk hurri aboutther was a general
movement among the peopl we inquir what it was all about and learn
that the emperor of the french and the sultan of turkey were about to
review twentyf thousand troop at the arc de letoil we
immedi depart i had a greater anxieti to see these men than i
could have had to see twenti exposit

we drove away and took up a posit in an open space opposit the
american minist hous a specul bridg a coupl of barrel with
a board and we hire stand place on it present there was a sound
of distant music in anoth minut a pillar of dust came move slowli
toward us a moment more and then with color fli and a grand crash
of militari music a gallant array of cavalrymen emerg from the dust
and came down the street on a gentl trot after them came a long line
of artilleri then more cavalri in splendid uniform and then their
imperi majesti napoleon iii and abdul aziz the vast concours of
peopl swung their hat and shoutedth window and housetop in the
wide vicin burst into a snowstorm of wave handkerchief and the
waver of the same mingl their cheer with those of the mass below
it was a stir spectacl

but the two central figur claim all my attent was ever such a
contrast set up befor a multitud till then napoleon in militari

cheer were not heartfelt and cordial

abdul aziz absolut lord of the ottoman empireclad in dark green
european cloth almost without ornament or insignia of rank a red
turkish fez on his head a short stout dark man blackbeard
blackey stupid unprepossessinga man whose whole appear
somehow suggest that if he onli had a cleaver in his hand and a white

him cast asid his plebeian vestment for the purpl of royalti who kept
his faith watch and walk his weari beat a common policeman of

abdulaziz sultan of turkey lord of the ottoman empir born to a

arabian night but has small regard for the mighti magician of today
and is nervous in the presenc of their mysteri railroad and

napoleon has augment the commerci prosper of franc in ten year
to such a degre that figur can hard comput it he has rebuilt
pari and has part rebuilt everi citi in the state he condemn a
whole street at a time assess the damag pay them and rebuild
superbl then specul buy up the ground and sell but the origin
owner is given the first choic by the govern at a state price
befor the specul is permit to purchas but abov all thing he
has taken the sole control of the empir of franc into his hand and
made it a toler free landfor peopl who will not attempt to go too
far in meddl with govern affair no countri offer greater
secur to life and properti than franc and one has all the freedom he
want but no licenseno licens to interfer with anybodi or make

as for the sultan one could set a trap ani where and catch a dozen abler
men in a night

the band struck up and the brilliant adventur napoleon iii the
genius of energi persist enterpris and the feebl abdulaziz the
genius of ignor bigotri and indol prepar for the forward

chapter xiv

we went to see the cathedr of notr dame we had heard of it befor
it surpris me sometim to think how much we do know and how
intellig we are we recogn the brown old gothic pile in a moment
it was like the pictur we stood at a littl distanc and chang from
one point of observ to anoth and gaze long at it lofti squar
tower and it rich front cluster thick with stoni mutil saint
who had been look calm down from their perch for age the
patriarch of jerusalem stood under them in the old day of chivalri and
romanc and preach the third crusad more than six hundr year ago
and sinc that day they have stood there and look quiet down upon the
most thrill scene the grandest pageant the most extraordinari
spectacl that have griev or delight pari these batter and
brokennos old fellow saw mani and mani a cavalcad of mailclad
knight come march home from holi land they heard the bell abov
them toll the signal for the st bartholomew massacr and they saw the
slaughter that follow later they saw the reign of terror the carnag
of the revolut the overthrow of a king the coron of two
napoleon the christen of the young princ that lord it over a
regiment of servant in the tuileri todayand they may possibl
continu to stand there until they see the napoleon dynasti swept away
and the banner of a great republ float abov it ruin i wish
these old parti could speak they could tell a tale worth the
listen to

they say that a pagan templ stood where notr dame now stand in the
old roman day eighteen or twenti centuri agoremain of it are still
preserv in pari and that a christian church took it place about a d
 anoth took the place of that in a d  and that the foundat
of the present cathedr were laid about a d  the ground ought to
be measur sacr by this time one would think one portion of this
nobl old edific is suggest of the quaint fashion of ancient time
it was built by jean sanspeur duke of burgundi to set his conscienc
at resth had assassin the duke of orlean ala those good old
time are gone when a murder could wipe the stain from his name and
sooth his troubl to sleep simpli by get out his brick and mortar
and build an addit to a church

the portal of the great western front are bisect by squar pillar
they took the central one away in  on the occas of thanksgiv
for the reinstitut of the presidenti powerbut precious soon they
had occas to reconsid that motion and put it back again and they
did

we loiter through the grand aisl for an hour or two stare up at
the rich stainedglass window embellish with blue and yellow and
crimson saint and martyr and tri to admir the numberless great
pictur in the chapel and then we were admit to the sacristi and
shown the magnific robe which the pope wore when he crown napoleon
i a wagonload of solid gold and silver utensil use in the great
public process and ceremoni of the church some nail of the true
cross a fragment of the cross itself a part of the crown of thorn
we had alreadi seen a larg piec of the true cross in a church in the
azor but no nail they show us likewis the bloodi robe which that
archbishop of pari wore who expos his sacr person and brave the
wrath of the insurg of  to mount the barricad and hold aloft
the oliv branch of peac in the hope of stop the slaughter his
nobl effort cost him his life he was shot dead they show us a cast
of his face taken after death the bullet that kill him and the two
vertebra in which it lodg these peopl have a somewhat singular
tast in the matter of relic ferguson told us that the silver cross
which the good archbishop wore at his girdl was seiz and thrown into
the sein where it lay embed in the mud for fifteen year and then
an angel appear to a priest and told him where to dive for it he did
dive for it and got it and now it is there on exhibit at notr dame
to be inspect by anybodi who feel an interest in inanim object of
miracul intervent

next we went to visit the morgu that horribl receptacl for the dead
who die mysteri and leav the manner of their take off a dismal
secret we stood befor a grate and look through into a room which
was hung all about with the cloth of dead men coars blous
watersoak the delic garment of women and children patrician
vestment hack and stab and stain with red a hat that was
crush and bloodi on a slant stone lay a drown man nake
swollen purpl clasp the fragment of a broken bush with a grip
which death had so petrifi that human strength could not unloos it
mute wit of the last despair effort to save the life that was
doom beyond all help a stream of water trickl ceaseless over the
hideous face we knew that the bodi and the cloth were there for
identif by friend but still we wonder if anybodi could love
that repuls object or griev for it loss we grew medit and
wonder if some forti year ago when the mother of that ghast thing
was dandl it upon her knee and kiss it and pet it and
display it with satisfi pride to the passersbi a prophet vision
of this dread end ever flit through her brain i half fear that
the mother or the wife or a brother of the dead man might come while we
stood there but noth of the kind occur men and women came and
some look eager in and press their face against the bar other
glanc careless at the bodi and turn away with a disappoint look
peopl i thought who live upon strong excit and who attend the
exhibit of the morgu regular just as other peopl go to see
theatric spectacl everi night when one of these look in and
pass on i could not help thinking

now this dont afford you ani satisfactiona parti with his head shot
off is what you need 

one night we went to the celebr jardin mabill but onli staid a
littl while we want to see some of this kind of pari life howev
and therefor the next night we went to a similar place of entertain
in a great garden in the suburb of asnier we went to the railroad
depot toward even and ferguson got ticket for a secondclass
carriag such a perfect jam of peopl i have not often seenbut there
was no nois no disord no rowdyism some of the women and young
girl that enter the train we knew to be of the demimond but other
we were not at all sure about

the girl and women in our carriag behav themselv modest and
becom all the way out except that they smoke when we arriv at
the garden in asnier we paid a franc or two admiss and enter a
place which had flower bed in it and grass plot and long curv
row of ornament shrubberi with here and there a seclud bower
conveni for eat ice cream in we move along the sinuous gravel
walk with the great concours of girl and young men and sudden a
dome and filigre white templ star over and over and over again
with brilliant gas jet burst upon us like a fallen sun nearbi was a
larg handsom hous with it ampl front illumin in the same way
and abov it roof float the starspangl banner of america

well  i said how is this  it near took my breath away

ferguson said an americana new yorkerkept the place and was carri
on quit a stir opposit to the jardin mabill

crowd compos of both sex and near all age were frisk about the
garden or sit in the open air in front of the flagstaff and the
templ drink wine and coffe or smoke the danc had not begun
yet ferguson said there was to be an exhibit the famous blondin
was go to perform on a tightrop in anoth part of the garden we
went thither here the light was dim and the mass of peopl were
pretti close pack togeth and now i made a mistak which ani
donkey might make but a sensibl man never i commit an error which
i find myself repeat everi day of my life stand right befor a
young ladi i said

dan just look at this girl how beauti she is 

i thank you more for the evid sincer of the compliment sir than
for the extraordinari public you have given to it  this in good
pure english

we took a walk but my spirit were veri veri sad dampen i did not
feel right comfort for some time afterward whi will peopl be so
stupid as to suppos themselv the onli foreign among a crowd of ten
thousand person

but blondin came out short he appear on a stretch cabl far away
abov the sea of toss hat and handkerchief and in the glare of the
hundr of rocket that whizz heavenward by him he look like a wee
insect he balanc his pole and walk the length of his ropetwo or
three hundr feet he came back and got a man and carri him across he
return to the center and danc a jig next he perform some gymnast
and balanc feat too peril to afford a pleasant spectacl and he
finish by fasten to his person a thousand roman candl catherin
wheel serpent and rocket of all manner of brilliant color set
them on fire all at onc and walk and waltz across his rope again
in a blind blaze of glori that lit up the garden and the peopl
face like a great conflagr at midnight

the danc had begun and we adjourn to the templ within it was a
drink saloon and all around it was a broad circular platform for the
dancer i back up against the wall of the templ and wait twenti
set form the music struck up and theni place my hand befor my
face for veri shame but i look through my finger they were danc
the renown cancan  a handsom girl in the set befor me trip
forward light to meet the opposit gentleman trip back again
grasp her dress vigor on both side with her hand rais them
pretti high danc an extraordinari jig that had more activ and
exposur about it than ani jig i ever saw befor and then draw her
cloth still higher she advanc gaili to the center and launch a
vicious kick full at her visavi that must infal have remov his
nose if he had been seven feet high it was a merci he was onli six

that is the cancan the idea of it is to danc as wild as noisili
as furious as you can expos yourself as much as possibl if you are a
woman and kick as high as you can no matter which sex you belong to
there is no word of exagger in this ani of the staid respect
age peopl who were there that night can testifi to the truth of that
statement there were a good mani such peopl present i suppos french
moral is not of that straightlac descript which is shock at
trifl

i move asid and took a general view of the cancan shout laughter
furious music a bewild chao of dart and intermingl form
stormi jerk and snatch of gay dress bob bead fli arm
lightn flash of whitestocking calv and dainti slipper in the
air and then a grand final rush riot a terrif hubbub and a wild
stamped heaven noth like it has been seen on earth sinc
trembl tam oshant saw the devil and the witch at their orgi
that stormi night in alloway auld haunt kirk 

we visit the louvr at a time when we had no silk purchas in view
and look at it mile of paint by the old master some of them
were beauti but at the same time they carri such evid about
them of the cring spirit of those great men that we found small
pleasur in examin them their nauseous adul of princ patron
was more promin to me and chain my attent more sure than the
charm of color and express which are claim to be in the pictur
gratitud for kind is well but it seem to me that some of those
artist carri it so far that it ceas to be gratitud and becam
worship if there is a plausibl excus for the worship of men then by
all mean let us forgiv ruben and his brethren

but i will drop the subject lest i say someth about the old master
that might as well be left unsaid

of cours we drove in the boi de boulogn that limitless park with it
forest it lake it cascad and it broad avenu there were
thousand upon thousand of vehicl abroad and the scene was full of
life and gaieti there were veri common hack with father and mother
and all the children in them conspicu littl open carriag with
celebr ladi of question reput in them there were duke
and duchess abroad with gorgeous footmen perch behind and equal
gorgeous outrid perch on each of the six hors there were blue and
silver and green and gold and pink and black and all sort and
descript of stun and startl liveri out and i almost yearn
to be a flunkey myself for the sake of the fine cloth

but present the emperor came along and he outshon them all he was
preced by a bodyguard of gentlemen on horseback in showi uniform his
carriagehors there appear to be somewher in the remot
neighborhood of a thousand of them were bestridden by gallantlook
fellow also in stylish uniform and after the carriag follow
anoth detach of bodyguard everybodi got out of the way
everybodi bow to the emperor and his friend the sultan and they went
by on a swing trot and disappear

i will not describ the boi de boulogn i can not do it it is simpli
a beauti cultiv endless wonder wilder it is an
enchant place it is in pari now one may say but a crumbl old
cross in one portion of it remind one that it was not alway so the
cross mark the spot where a celebr troubadour was waylaid and
murder in the fourteenth centuri it was in this park that that fellow
with an unpronounc name made the attempt upon the russian czar
life last spring with a pistol the bullet struck a tree ferguson
show us the place now in america that interest tree would be
chop down or forgotten within the next five year but it will be
treasur here the guid will point it out to visitor for the next
eight hundr year and when it decay and fall down they will put up
anoth there and go on with the same old stori just the same




chapter xv

one of our pleasantest visit was to pere la chais the nation
buryingground of franc the honor restingplac of some of her
greatest and best children the last home of score of illustri men
and women who were born to no titl but achiev fame by their own
energi and their own genius it is a solemn citi of wind street and
of miniatur marbl templ and mansion of the dead gleam white from
out a wilder of foliag and fresh flower not everi citi is so well
peopl as this or has so ampl an area within it wall few palac
exist in ani citi that are so exquisit in design so rich in art so
cost in materi so grace so beauti

we had stood in the ancient church of st deni where the marbl
effigi of thirti generat of king and queen lay stretch at
length upon the tomb and the sensat invok were startl and
novel the curious armor the obsolet costum the placid face the
hand place palm to palm in eloqu supplicationit was a vision of
gray antiqu it seem curious enough to be stand face to face as

yet who realli know the stori of abelard and helois precious few
peopl the name are perfect familiar to everi bodi and that is
about all with infinit pain i have acquir a knowledg of that
histori and i propos to narrat it here part for the honest
inform of the public and part to show that public that they have
been wast a good deal of market sentiment veri unnecessarili


stori of abelard and helois

helois was born seven hundr and sixtysix year ago she may have had
parent there is no tell she live with her uncl fulbert a canon
of the cathedr of pari i do not know what a canon of a cathedr is
but that is what he was he was noth more than a sort of a mountain
howitz like becaus they had no heavi artilleri in those day
suffic it then that helois live with her uncl the howitz and was
happi she spent the most of her childhood in the convent of argenteuil
never heard of argenteuil befor but suppos there was realli such a
place she then return to her uncl the old gun or son of a gun as
the case may be and he taught her to write and speak latin which was
the languag of literatur and polit societi at that period

just at this time pierr abelard who had alreadi made himself wide
famous as a rhetorician came to found a school of rhetor in pari
the origin of his principl his eloqu and his great physic
strength and beauti creat a profound sensat he saw helois and
was captiv by her bloom youth her beauti and her charm
disposit he wrote to her she answer he wrote again she
answer again he was now in love he long to know herto speak to
her face to face

his school was near fulbert hous he ask fulbert to allow him to
call the good old swivel saw here a rare opportun his niec whom
he so much love would absorb knowledg from this man and it would not
cost him a cent such was fulbertpenuri

fulbert first name is not mention by ani author which is
unfortun howev georg w fulbert will answer for him as well as
ani other we will let him go at that he ask abelard to teach her

abelard was glad enough of the opportun he came often and staid
long a letter of his show in it veri first sentenc that he came
under that friend roof like a coldheart villain as he was with the
deliber intent of debauch a confid innoc girl this is
the letter

i cannot ceas to be astonish at the simplic of fulbert
i was as much surpris as if he had place a lamb in the power
of a hungri wolf helois and i under pretext of studi gave
ourselv up wholli to love and the solitud that love seek
our studi procur for us book were open befor us but we
spoke often of love than philosophi and kiss came more
readili from our lip than word 

and so exult over an honor confid which to his degrad
instinct was a ludicr simplic  this unman abelard seduc the
niec of the man whose guest he was pari found it out fulbert was
told of ittold oftenbut refus to believ it he could not
comprehend how a man could be so deprav as to use the sacr protect
and secur of hospit as a mean for the commiss of such a crime
as that but when he heard the rowdi in the street sing the
lovesong of abelard to helois the case was too plainlovesong come
not proper within the teach of rhetor and philosophi

he drove abelard from his hous abelard return secret and carri
helois away to palai in brittani his nativ countri here short
afterward she bore a son who from his rare beauti was surnam
astrolabewilliam g the girl flight enrag fulbert and he long
for vengeanc but fear to strike lest retali visit heloisefor
he still love her tender at length abelard offer to marri helois
but on a shame condit that the marriag should be kept secret
from the world to the end that while her good name remain a wreck as
befor his priest reput might be kept untarnish it was like
that miscreant fulbert saw his opportun and consent he would see
the parti marri and then violat the confid of the man who had
taught him that trick he would divulg the secret and so remov somewhat
of the obloquy that attach to his niec fame but the niec
suspect his scheme she refus the marriag at first she said
fulbert would betray the secret to save her and besid she did not
wish to drag down a lover who was so gift so honor by the world
and who had such a splendid career befor him it was nobl
selfsacrif love and characterist of the puresoul helois
but it was not good sens

but she was overrul and the privat marriag took place now for
fulbert the heart so wound should be heal at last the proud spirit
so tortur should find rest again the humbl head should be lift up
onc more he proclaim the marriag in the high place of the citi and
rejoic that dishonor had depart from his hous but lo abelard
deni the marriag helois deni it the peopl know the former
circumst might have believ fulbert had onli abelard deni it
but when the person chiefli interestedth girl herselfdeni it they
laugh despair fulbert to scorn

the poor canon of the cathedr of pari was spike again the last hope
of repair the wrong that had been done his hous was gone what next
human natur suggest reveng he compass it the historian say

ruffian hire by fulbert fell upon abelard by night and
inflict upon him a terribl and nameless mutil 

i am seek the last rest place of those ruffian  when i find it
i shall shed some tear on it and stack up some bouquet and
immortell and cart away from it some gravel wherebi to rememb that
howsoev blot by crime their live may have been these ruffian did
one just deed at ani rate albeit it was not warrant by the strict
letter of the law

helois enter a convent and gave goodby to the world and it
pleasur for all time for twelv year she never heard of abelard
never even heard his name mention she had becom prioress of
argenteuil and led a life of complet seclus she happen one day to
see a letter written by him in which he narrat his own histori she
cri over it and wrote him he answer address her as his sister
in christ  they continu to correspond she in the unweigh languag
of unwav affect he in the chilli phraseolog of the polish
rhetorician she pour out her heart in passion disjoint
sentenc he repli with finish essay divid deliber into
head and subhead premis and argument she shower upon him the
tenderest epithet that love could devis he address her from the
north pole of his frozen heart as the spous of christ  the abandon
villain

on account of her too easi govern of her nun some disreput
irregular were discov among them and the abbot of st deni
broke up her establish abelard was the offici head of the
monasteri of st gilda de ruy at that time and when he heard of her
homeless condit a sentiment of piti was arous in his breast it is a
wonder the unfamiliar emot did not blow his head off and he place
her and her troop in the littl oratori of the paraclet a religi
establish which he had found she had mani privat and
suffer to undergo at first but her worth and her gentl disposit
won influenti friend for her and she built up a wealthi and
flourish nunneri she becam a great favorit with the head of the
church and also the peopl though she seldom appear in public she
rapid advanc in esteem in good report and in use and
abelard as rapid lost ground the pope so honor her that he made her
the head of her order abelard a man of splendid talent and rank
as the first debat of his time becam timid irresolut and
distrust of his power he onli need a great misfortun to toppl
him from the high posit he held in the world of intellectu
excel and it came urg by king and princ to meet the subtl
st bernard in debat and crush him he stood up in the presenc of a
royal and illustri assemblag and when his antagonist had finish he
look about him and stammer a commenc but his courag fail
him the cun of his tongu was gone with his speech unspoken he
trembl and sat down a disgrac and vanquish champion

he die a nobodi and was buri at cluni a d  they remov his
bodi to the paraclet afterward and when helois die twenti year
later they buri her with him in accord with her last wish he
die at the ripe age of  and she at  after the bodi had remain
entomb three hundr year they were remov onc more they were
remov again in  and final seventeen year afterward they were
taken up and transfer to pere la chais where they will remain in
peac and quiet until it come time for them to get up and move again

histori is silent concern the last act of the mountain howitz let
the world say what it will about him i at least shall alway respect
the memori and sorrow for the abus trust and the broken heart and the
troubl spirit of the old smoothbor rest and repos be his

such is the stori of abelard and helois such is the histori that
lamartin has shed such cataract of tear over but that man never
could come within the influenc of a subject in the least pathet
without overflow his bank he ought to be dammedor leve i
should more proper say such is the historynot as it is usual
told but as it is when strip of the nauseous sentiment that
would enshrin for our love worship a dastard seduc like pierr
abelard i have not a word to say against the misus faith girl
and would not withhold from her grave a singl one of those simpl
tribut which blight youth and maiden offer to her memori but i am
sorri enough that i have not time and opportun to write four or five
volum of my opinion of her friend the founder of the parachut or the
paraclet or whatev it was

the ton of sentiment i have wast on that unprincipl humbug in my
ignor i shall throttl down my emot hereaft about this sort
of peopl until i have read them up and know whether they are entitl
to ani tear attent or not i wish i had my immortell back now
and that bunch of radish

in pari we often saw in shop window the sign english spoken here 
just as one see in the window at home the sign ici on parl
francais  we alway invad these place at onceand invari
receiv the inform frame in faultless french that the clerk who
did the english for the establish had just gone to dinner and would
be back in an hourwould monsieur buy someth we wonder whi those
parti happen to take their dinner at such errat and extraordinari
hour for we never call at a time when an exemplari christian would be
in the least like to be abroad on such an errand the truth was it
was a base frauda snare to trap the unwarychaff to catch fledgl
with they had no englishmurd clerk they trust to the sign to
inveigl foreign into their lair and trust to their own
blandish to keep them there till they bought someth

we ferret out anoth french impositiona frequent sign to this
effect all manner of american drink artist prepar here  we
procur the servic of a gentleman experienc in the nomenclatur of
the american bar and move upon the work of one of these impostor a
bow apron frenchman skip forward and said

que voulez les messieur  i do not know what que voulez les
messieur  mean but such was his remark

our general said we will take a whiskey straight 

a stare from the frenchman 

well if you dont know what that is give us a champagn cocktail 

a stare and a shrug 

well then give us a sherri cobbler 

the frenchman was checkmat this was all greek to him

give us a brandi smash 

the frenchman began to back away suspici of the omin vigor of the
last orderbegan to back away shrug his shoulder and spread his
hand apologet

the general follow him up and gain a complet victori the
uneduc foreign could not even furnish a santa cruz punch an
eyeopen a stonef or an earthquak it was plain that he was a
wick impostor

an acquaint of mine said the other day that he was doubtless the onli
american visitor to the exposit who had had the high honor of be
escort by the emperor bodyguard i said with unobtrus frank
that i was astonish that such a longleg lanternjaw
unprepossessinglook specter as he should be singl out for a
distinct like that and ask how it came about he said he had
attend a great militari review in the champ de mar some time ago and
while the multitud about him was grow thicker and thicker everi
moment he observ an open space insid the rail he left his
carriag and went into it he was the onli person there and so he had
plenti of room and the situat be central he could see all the
prepar go on about the field by and by there was a sound of
music and soon the emperor of the french and the emperor of austria
escort by the famous cent gard enter the enclosur they seem
not to observ him but direct in respons to a sign from the
command of the guard a young lieuten came toward him with a file of
his men follow halt rais his hand and gave the militari salut
and then said in a low voic that he was sorri to have to disturb a
stranger and a gentleman but the place was sacr to royalti then this
new jersey phantom rose up and bow and beg pardon then with the
offic besid him the file of men march behind him and with everi
mark of respect he was escort to his carriag by the imperi cent
gard the offic salut again and fell back the new jersey sprite
bow in return and had presenc of mind enough to pretend that he had
simpli call on a matter of privat busi with those emperor and so
wave them an adieu and drove from the field

imagin a poor frenchman ignor intrud upon a public rostrum
sacr to some sixpenni dignitari in america the polic would scare
him to death first with a storm of their eleg blasphemi and then pull
him to piec get him away from there we are measur superior to
the french in some thing but they are immeasur our better in
other

enough of pari for the present we have done our whole duti by it we
have seen the tuileri the napoleon column the madelein that wonder
of wonder the tomb of napoleon all the great church and museum
librari imperi palac and sculptur and pictur galleri the
pantheon jardin des plant the opera the circus the legisl
bodi the billiard room the barber the grisettes

ah the grisett i had almost forgotten they are anoth romant
fraud they were if you let the book of travel tell it alway so
beautifulso neat and trim so gracefulso naiv and trustingso
gentl so winningso faith to their shop duti so irresist
to buyer in their prattl importunityso devot to their
povertystricken student of the latin quarterso lightheart and
happi on their sunday picnic in the suburbsand oh so charm
so delight immor

stuff for three or four day i was constant say

quick ferguson is that a grisett 

and he alway said no 

he comprehend at last that i want to see a grisett then he show
me dozen of them they were like near all the frenchwomen i ever saw
home they had larg hand larg feet larg mouth they had pug
nose as a general thing and moustach that not even good breed
could overlook they comb their hair straight back without part
they were illshap they were not win they were not grace i
knew by their look that they ate garlic and onion and last and
final to my think it would be base flatteri to call them immor

aroint thee wench i sorrow for the vagabond student of the latin
quarter now even more than former i envi him thus toppl to earth
anoth idol of my infanc

we have seen everi thing and tomorrow we go to versaill we shall see
pari onli for a littl while as we come back to take up our line of
march for the ship and so i may as well bid the beauti citi a
regret farewel we shall travel mani thousand of mile after we
leav here and visit mani great citi but we shall find none so
enchant as this

some of our parti have gone to england intend to take a roundabout
cours and rejoin the vessel at leghorn or napl sever week henc
we came near go to geneva but have conclud to return to marseill
and go up through itali from genoa

i will conclud this chapter with a remark that i am sincer proud to
be abl to makeand glad as well that my comrad cordial endors
it to wit by far the handsomest women we have seen in franc were born
and rear in america

i feel now like a man who has redeem a fail reput and shed
luster upon a dim escutcheon by a singl just deed done at the
eleventh hour

let the curtain fall to slow music




chapter xvi

versaill it is wonder beauti you gaze and stare and tri to
understand that it is real that it is on the earth that it is not the
garden of edenbut your brain grow giddi stupefi by the world of
beauti around you and you half believ you are the dupe of an exquisit
dream the scene thrill one like militari music a nobl palac
stretch it ornament front block upon block away till it seem
that it would never end a grand promenad befor it whereon the armi
of an empir might parad all about it rainbow of flower and coloss
statu that were almost numberless and yet seem onli scatter over
the ampl space broad flight of stone step lead down from the
promenad to lower ground of the parkstairway that whole regiment
might stand to arm upon and have room to spare vast fountain whose
great bronz effigi discharg river of sparkl water into the air
and mingl a hundr curv jet togeth in form of matchless beauti
wide grasscarpet avenu that branch hither and thither in everi
direct and wander to seem intermin distanc wall all
the way on either side with compact rank of leafi tree whose branch
met abov and form arch as faultless and as symmetr as ever were
carv in stone and here and there were glimps of sylvan lake with
miniatur ship glass in their surfac and everi whereon the
palac step and the great promenad around the fountain among the
tree and far under the arch of the endless avenueshundr and
hundr of peopl in gay costum walk or ran or danc and gave to
the fairi pictur the life and anim which was all of perfect it
could have lack

it was worth a pilgrimag to see everyth is on so gigant a scale
noth is smallnoth is cheap the statu are all larg the
palac is grand the park cover a fairsiz counti the avenu are
intermin all the distanc and all the dimens about versaill
are vast i use to think the pictur exagger these distanc and
these dimens beyond all reason and that they made versaill more
beauti than it was possibl for ani place in the world to be i know
now that the pictur never came up to the subject in ani respect and
that no painter could repres versaill on canva as beauti as it
is in realiti i use to abus loui xiv for spend two hundr
million of dollar in creat this marvel park when bread was so
scarc with some of his subject but i have forgiven him now he took a
tract of land sixti mile in circumfer and set to work to make this
park and build this palac and a road to it from pari he kept  
men employ daili on it and the labor was so unhealthi that they use
to die and be haul off by cartload everi night the wife of a
nobleman of the time speak of this as an inconveni  but naiv
remark that it doe not seem worthi of attent in the happi state of
tranquil we now enjoy 

i alway thought ill of peopl at home who trim their shrubberi into
pyramid and squar and spire and all manner of unnatur shape and
when i saw the same thing be practic in this great park i began to
feel dissatisfi but i soon saw the idea of the thing and the wisdom
of it they seek the general effect we distort a dozen sick tree
into unaccustom shape in a littl yard no bigger than a dine room
and then sure they look absurd enough but here they take two hundr
thousand tall forest tree and set them in a doubl row allow no sign of
leaf or branch to grow on the trunk lower down than six feet abov the
ground from that point the bough begin to project and veri gradual
they extend outward further and further till they meet overhead and a
faultless tunnel of foliag is form the arch is mathemat
precis the effect is then veri fine they make tree take fifti
differ shape and so these quaint effect are infinit vari and
picturesqu the tree in no two avenu are shape alik and
consequ the eye is not fatigu with anyth in the natur of
monoton uniform i will drop this subject now leav it to
other to determin how these peopl manag to make endless rank of
lofti forest tree grow to just a certain thick of trunk say a foot
and twothird how they make them spring to precis the same height
for mile how they make them grow so close togeth how they compel one
huge limb to spring from the same ident spot on each tree and form
the main sweep of the arch and how all these thing are kept exact in
the same condit and in the same exquisit shapeli and symmetri
month after month and year after yearfor i have tri to reason out the
problem and have fail

we walk through the great hall of sculptur and the one hundr and
fifti galleri of paint in the palac of versaill and felt that
to be in such a place was useless unless one had a whole year at his
dispos these pictur are all battl scene and onli one solitari
littl canva among them all treat of anyth but great french
victori we wander also through the grand trianon and the petit
trianon those monument of royal prodig and with histori so
mournfulfil as it is with souvenir of napoleon the first and
three dead king and as mani queen in one sumptuous bed they had all
slept in success but no one occupi it now in a larg dine room
stood the tabl at which loui xiv and his mistress madam maintenon and
after them loui xv and pompadour had sat at their meal nake and
unattendedfor the tabl stood upon a trapdoor which descend with it
to region below when it was necessari to replenish it dish in a
room of the petit trianon stood the furnitur just as poor mari
antoinett left it when the mob came and drag her and the king to
pari never to return near at hand in the stabl were prodigi
carriag that show no color but goldcarriag use by former king
of franc on state occas and never use now save when a king head
is to be crown or an imperi infant christen and with them were
some curious sleigh whose bodi were shape like lion swan tiger
etc vehicl that had onc been handsom with pictur design and
fine workmanship but were dusti and decay now they had their
histori when loui xiv had finish the grand trianon he told
maintenon he had creat a paradis for her and ask if she could think
of anyth now to wish for he said he wish the trianon to be
perfectionnoth less she said she could think of but one thingit
was summer and it was balmi franceyet she would like well to sleigh
ride in the leafi avenu of versaill the next morn found mile
and mile of grassi avenu spread thick with snowi salt and sugar and a
process of those quaint sleigh wait to receiv the chief concubin
of the gaiest and most unprincipl court that franc has ever seen

from sumptuous versaill with it palac it statu it garden
and it fountain we journey back to pari and sought it antipod
the faubourg st antoin littl narrow street dirti children
blockad them greasi sloven women captur and spank them
filthi den on first floor with rag store in them the heaviest
busi in the faubourg is the chiffoni other filthi den where
whole suit of second and thirdhand cloth are sold at price that
would ruin ani proprietor who did not steal his stock still other filthi
den where they sold groceriessold them by the halfpennyworthf
dollar would buy the man out goodwil and all up these littl crook
street they will murder a man for seven dollar and dump the bodi in the
sein and up some other of these streetsmost of them i should say
live lorett

all through this faubourg st antoin miseri poverti vice and crime
go hand in hand and the evid of it stare one in the face from everi
side here the peopl live who begin the revolut whenev there is
anyth of that kind to be done they are alway readi they take as
much genuin pleasur in build a barricad as they do in cut a
throat or shove a friend into the sein it is these savagelook
ruffian who storm the splendid hall of the tuileri occasion and
swarm into versaill when a king is to be call to account

but they will build no more barricad they will break no more soldier
head with pavingston loui napoleon has taken care of all that he
is annihil the crook street and build in their stead nobl
boulevard as straight as an arrowavenu which a cannon ball could
travers from end to end without meet an obstruct more irresist

chapter xvii

we had a pleasant journey of it seaward again we found that for the
three past night our ship had been in a state of war the first night
the sailor of a british ship be happi with grog came down on the
pier and challeng our sailor to a free fight they accept with
alacr repair to the pier and gainedtheir share of a drawn
battl sever bruis and bloodi member of both parti were carri
off by the polic and imprison until the follow morn the next
night the british boy came again to renew the fight but our men had had
strict order to remain on board and out of sight they did so and the
besieg parti grew noisi and more and more abus as the fact becam
appar to them that our men were afraid to come out they went away
final with a close burst of ridicul and offens epithet the
third night they came again and were more obstreper than ever they
swagger up and down the almost desert pier and hurl curs
obscen and sting sarcasm at our crew it was more than human
natur could bear the execut offic order our men ashorewith
instruct not to fight they charg the british and gain a
brilliant victori i probabl would not have mention this war had it
end differ but i travel to learn and i still rememb that they
pictur no french defeat in the battlegalleri of versaill

it was like home to us to step on board the comfort ship again and
smoke and loung about her breezi deck and yet it was not altogeth
like home either becaus so mani member of the famili were away we
miss some pleasant face which we would rather have found at dinner
and at night there were gap in the euchreparti which could not be
satisfactorili fill moult was in england jack in switzerland
charley in spain blucher was gone none could tell where but we were
at sea again and we had the star and the ocean to look at and plenti
of room to medit in

in due time the shore of itali were sight and as we stood gaze from
the deck earli in the bright summer morn the state citi of genoa
rose up out of the sea and flung back the sunlight from her hundr
palac

here we rest for the presentor rather here we have been tri to
rest for some littl time but we run about too much to accomplish a
great deal in that line

i would like to remain here i had rather not go ani further there may
be prettier women in europ but i doubt it the popul of genoa is
  twothird of these are women i think and at least twothird
of the women are beauti they are as dressi and as tast and as
grace as they could possibl be without be angel howev angel
are not veri dressi i believ at least the angel in pictur are not
they wear noth but wing but these genoes women do look so
charm most of the young demoisell are robe in a cloud of white
from head to foot though mani trick themselv out more elabor
ninetenth of them wear noth on their head but a filmi sort of veil
which fall down their back like a white mist they are veri fair and
mani of them have blue eye but black and dreami dark brown one are met
with oftenest

the ladi and gentlemen of genoa have a pleasant fashion of promenad
in a larg park on the top of a hill in the center of the citi from six
till nine in the even and then eat ice in a neighbor garden an
hour or two longer we went to the park on sunday even two thousand
person were present chiefli young ladi and gentlemen the gentlemen
were dress in the veri latest pari fashion and the robe of the
ladi glint among the tree like so mani snowflak the multitud
move round and round the park in a great process the band play
and so did the fountain the moon and the gas lamp lit up the scene
and altogeth it was a brilliant and an anim pictur i scan
everi femal face that pass and it seem to me that all were
handsom i never saw such a freshet of loveli befor i did not
see how a man of onli ordinari decis of charact could marri here
becaus befor he could get his mind made up he would fall in love with
somebodi els

never smoke ani italian tobacco never do it on ani account it make
me shudder to think what it must be made of you cannot throw an old
cigar stub down anywher but some vagabond will pounc upon it on the
instant i like to smoke a good deal but it wound my sensibl to
see one of these stubhunt watch me out of the corner of his
hungri eye and calcul how long my cigar will be like to last
it remind me too pain of that san francisco undertak who use to
go to sickb with his watch in his hand and time the corps one of
these stubhunt follow us all over the park last night and we never
had a smoke that was worth anyth we were alway move to appeas him
with the stub befor the cigar was half gone becaus he look so
vicious anxious he regard us as his own legitim prey by right
of discoveri i think becaus he drove off sever other profession
who want to take stock in us

now they sure must chew up those old stub and dri and sell them for
smokingtobacco therefor give your custom to other than italian
brand of the articl

the superb and the citi of palaces are name which genoa has held for
centuri she is full of palac certain and the palac are
sumptuous insid but they are veri rusti without and make no pretens
to architectur magnific genoa the superb would be a felicit
titl if it refer to the women

we have visit sever of the palacesimmens thickwal pile with
great stone staircas tessel marbl pavement on the floor
sometim they make a mosaic work of intric design wrought in
pebbl or littl fragment of marbl laid in cement and grand salon
hung with pictur by ruben guido titian paul verones and so on
and portrait of head of the famili in plume helmet and gallant coat
of mail and patrician ladi in stun costum of centuri ago
but of cours the folk were all out in the countri for the summer and
might not have known enough to ask us to dinner if they had been at home
and so all the grand empti salon with their resound pavement their
grim pictur of dead ancestor and tatter banner with the dust of
bygon centuri upon them seem to brood solemn of death and the
grave and our spirit eb away and our cheer pass from us
we never went up to the eleventh stori we alway began to suspect
ghost there was alway an undertakerlook servant along too who
hand us a program point to the pictur that began the list of the
salon he was in and then stood stiff and stark and unsmil in his
petrifi liveri till we were readi to move on to the next chamber
whereupon he march sad ahead and took up anoth malign
respect posit as befor i wast so much time pray that the
roof would fall in on these dispirit flunki that i had but littl
left to bestow upon palac and pictur

and besid as in pari we had a guid perdit catch all the
guid this one said he was the most gift linguist in genoa as far
as english was concern and that onli two person in the citi besid
himself could talk the languag at all he show us the birthplac of
christoph columbus and after we had reflect in silent awe befor it
for fifteen minut he said it was not the birthplac of columbus but
of columbus grandmoth when we demand an explan of his conduct
he onli shrug his shoulder and answer in barbar italian i
shall speak further of this guid in a futur chapter all the
inform we got out of him we shall be abl to carri along with us i
think

i have not been to church so often in a long time as i have in the last
few week the peopl in these old land seem to make church their
specialti especi doe this seem to be the case with the citizen of
genoa i think there is a church everi three or four hundr yard all
over town the street are sprinkl from end to end with shovelhat
longrob wellf priest and the church bell by dozen are peal
all the day long near everi now and then one come across a friar of
order gray with shaven head long coars robe rope girdl and bead
and with feet case in sandal or entir bare these worthi suffer
in the flesh and do penanc all their live i suppos but they look
like consumm faminebreed they are all fat and seren

the old cathedr of san lorenzo is about as notabl a build as we
have found in genoa it is vast and has colonnad of nobl pillar
and a great organ and the customari pomp of gild mold pictur
fresco ceil and so forth i cannot describ it of courseit
would requir a good mani page to do that but it is a curious place
they said that half of itfrom the front door halfway down to the altar
was a jewish synagogu befor the saviour was born and that no
alter had been made in it sinc that time we doubt the
statement but did it reluct we would much rather have believ
it the place look in too perfect repair to be so ancient

the main point of interest about the cathedr is the littl chapel of
st john the baptist they onli allow women to enter it on one day in
the year on account of the animos they still cherish against the sex
becaus of the murder of the saint to gratifi a capric of herodia in
this chapel is a marbl chest in which they told us were the ash of
st john and around it was wound a chain which they said had confin
him when he was in prison we did not desir to disbeliev these
statement and yet we could not feel certain that they were correct
part becaus we could have broken that chain and so could st john
and part becaus we had seen st john ash befor in anoth
church we could not bring ourselv to think st john had two set of
ash

they also show us a portrait of the madonna which was paint by st
luke and it did not look half as old and smoki as some of the pictur
by ruben we could not help admir the apostl modesti in never
onc mention in his write that he could paint

but isnt this relic matter a littl overdon we find a piec of the
true cross in everi old church we go into and some of the nail that
held it togeth i would not like to be posit but i think we have
seen as much as a keg of these nail then there is the crown of thorn
they have part of one in saint chapell in pari and part of one also
in notr dame and as for bone of st deni i feel certain we have
seen enough of them to duplic him if necessari

i onli meant to write about the church but i keep wander from the
subject i could say that the church of the annunci is a wilder
of beauti column of statu gild mold and pictur almost
countless but that would give no one an entir perfect idea of the
thing and so where is the use one famili built the whole edific and
have got money left there is where the mysteri lie we had an idea at
first that onli a mint could have surviv the expens

these peopl here live in the heaviest highest broadest darkest
solidest hous one can imagin each one might laugh a sieg to
scorn  a hundr feet front and a hundr high is about the style and
you go up three flight of stair befor you begin to come upon sign of
occup everyth is stone and stone of the heaviestfloor
stairway mantel bencheseveryth the wall are four to five feet
thick the street general are four or five to eight feet wide and as
crook as a corkscrew you go along one of these gloomi crack and
look up and behold the sky like a mere ribbon of light far abov your
head where the top of the tall hous on either side of the street bend
almost togeth you feel as if you were at the bottom of some
tremend abyss with all the world far abov you you wind in and out
and here and there in the most mysteri way and have no more idea of
the point of the compass than if you were a blind man you can never
persuad yourself that these are actual street and the frown
dingi monstrous hous dwell till you see one of these beauti
prettili dress women emerg from themse her emerg from a dark
drearylook den that look dungeon all over from the ground away
halfway up to heaven and then you wonder that such a charm moth
could come from such a forbid shell as that the street are wise
made narrow and the hous heavi and thick and stoni in order that the
peopl may be cool in this roast climat and they are cool and stay
so and while i think of itth men wear hat and have veri dark
complexion but the women wear no headgear but a flimsi veil like a
gossam web and yet are exceed fair as a general thing
singular isnt it

the huge palac of genoa are each suppos to be occupi by one famili
but they could accommod a hundr i should think they are relic of
the grandeur of genoa palmi daysth day when she was a great
commerci and maritim power sever centuri ago these hous solid
marbl palac though they be are in mani case of a dull pinkish color
outsid and from pavement to eav are pictur with genoes battl
scene with monstrous jupit and cupid and with familiar
illustr from grecian mytholog where the paint has yield to age
and exposur and is peel off in flake and patch the effect is not
happi a noseless cupid or a jupit with an eye out or a venus with a
flyblist on her breast are not attract featur in a pictur
some of these paint wall remind me somewhat of the tall van
plaster with fanci bill and poster that follow the bandwagon of
a circus about a countri villag i have not read or heard that the
outsid of the hous of ani other european citi are fresco in this
way

i can not conceiv of such a thing as genoa in ruin such massiv
arch such ponder substruct as support these tower
broadwing edific we have seldom seen befor and sure the great
block of stone of which these edific are built can never decay wall
that are as thick as an ordinari american doorway is high cannot
crumbl

the republ of genoa and pisa were veri power in the middl age
their ship fill the mediterranean and they carri on an extens
commerc with constantinopl and syria their warehous were the great
distribut depot from whenc the cost merchandis of the east was
sent abroad over europ they were warlik littl nation and defi in
those day govern that overshadow them now as mountain overshadow
molehil the saracen captur and pillag genoa nine hundr year
ago but dure the follow centuri genoa and pisa enter into an
offens and defens allianc and besieg the saracen coloni in
sardinia and the balear isl with an obstinaci that maintain it
pristin vigor and held to it purpos for forti long year they were
victori at last and divid their conquest equabl among their great
patrician famili descend of some of those proud famili still
inhabit the palac of genoa and trace in their own featur a
resembl to the grim knight whose portrait hang in their state
hall and to pictur beauti with pout lip and merri eye whose
origin have been dust and ash for mani a dead and forgotten centuri

the hotel we live in belong to one of those great order of knight of
the cross in the time of the crusad and it mail sentinel onc
kept watch and ward in it massiv turret and woke the echo of these
hall and corridor with their iron heel

but genoa great has degener into an unostentati commerc in
velvet and silver filagreework they say that each european town has
it specialti these filagre thing are genoa specialti her smith
take silver ingot and work them up into all manner of grace and
beauti form they make bunch of flower from flake and wire of
silver that counterfeit the delic creation the frost weav upon a
windowpan and we were shown a miniatur silver templ whose flute
column whose corinthian capit and rich entablatur whose spire
statu bell and ornat lavish of sculptur were wrought in
polish silver and with such matchless art that everi detail was a
fascin studi and the finish edific a wonder of beauti

we are readi to move again though we are not realli tire yet of the
narrow passag of this old marbl cave cave is a good wordwhen
speak of genoa under the star when we have been prowl at
midnight through the gloomi crevic they call street where no
footfal but our were echo where onli ourselv were abroad and
light appear onli at long interv and at a distanc and
mysteri disappear again and the hous at our elbow seem to
stretch upward farther than ever toward the heaven the memori of a cave
i use to know at home was alway in my mind with it lofti passag
it silenc and solitud it shroud gloom it sepulchr echo it
flit light and more than all it sudden revel of branch
crevic and corridor where we least expect them

we are not tire of the endless process of cheer chatter
gossip that throng these court and street all day long either nor
of the coarserob monk nor of the asti wine which that old doctor
whom we call the oracl with customari felic in the matter of
get everyth wrong misterm nasti  but we must go
nevertheless

our last sight was the cemeteri a burial place intend to accommod
  bodi and we shall continu to rememb it after we shall have
forgotten the palac it is a vast marbl collonad corridor extend

everi featur guiltless of mutil flaw or blemish and therefor
to us these farreach rank of bewitch form are a hundr fold
more love than the damag and dingi statuari they have save from the

chapter xviii

all day long we sped through a mountain countri whose peak were
bright with sunshin whose hillsid were dot with pretti villa
sit in the midst of garden and shrubberi and whose deep ravin
were cool and shadi and look ever so invit from where we and the
bird were wing our flight through the sultri upper air

we had plenti of chilli tunnel wherein to check our perspir
though we time one of them we were twenti minut pass through
it go at the rate of thirti to thirtyf mile an hour

beyond alessandria we pass the battlefield of marengo

toward dusk we drew near milan and caught glimps of the citi and the
blue mountain peak beyond but we were not care for these thing
they did not interest us in the least we were in a fever of impati
we were die to see the renown cathedr we watchedin this
direct and thatal aroundeverywher we need no one to point it
outw did not wish ani one to point it outw would recogn it even
in the desert of the great sahara

at last a forest of grace needl shimmer in the amber sunlight
rose slowli abov the pygmi housetop as one sometim see in the far
horizon a gild and pinnacl mass of cloud lift itself abov the wast
of wave at sea the cathedr we knew it in a moment

half of that night and all of the next day this architectur autocrat
was our sole object of interest

what a wonder it is so grand so solemn so vast and yet so delic
so airi so grace a veri world of solid weight and yet it seem in
the soft moonlight onli a fairi delus of frostwork that might vanish
with a breath how sharpli it pinnacl angl and it wilder of
spire were cut against the sky and how rich their shadow fell upon
it snowi roof it was a vision a miracl an anthem sung in stone a
poem wrought in marbl

howsoev you look at the great cathedr it is nobl it is beauti
wherev you stand in milan or within seven mile of milan it is visibl
and when it is visibl no other object can chain your whole attent
leav your eye unfett by your will but a singl instant and they
will sure turn to seek it it is the first thing you look for when you
rise in the morn and the last your linger gaze rest upon at
night sure it must be the princeliest creation that ever brain of man
conceiv

at nine oclock in the morn we went and stood befor this marbl
colossus the central one of it five great door is border with a
basrelief of bird and fruit and beast and insect which have been so
ingeni carv out of the marbl that they seem like live
creaturesand the figur are so numer and the design so complex that
one might studi it a week without exhaust it interest on the great
steeplesurmount the myriad of spiresinsid of the spiresov the
door the windowsin nook and cornerseveri where that a nich or a
perch can be found about the enorm build from summit to base
there is a marbl statu and everi statu is a studi in itself
raphael angelo canovagi like these gave birth to the design and
their own pupil carv them everi face is eloqu with express
and everi attitud is full of grace away abov on the lofti roof rank
on rank of carv and fret spire spring high in the air and through
their rich traceri one see the sky beyond in their midst the central
steepl tower proud up like the mainmast of some great indiaman among
a fleet of coaster

we wish to go aloft the sacristan show us a marbl stairway of
cours it was marbl and of the purest and whitestther is no other
stone no brick no wood among it build materi and told us to go
up one hundr and eightytwo step and stop till he came it was not
necessari to say stopw should have done that ani how we were tire
by the time we got there this was the roof here spring from it
broad marbl flagston were the long file of spire look veri tall
close at hand but diminish in the distanc like the pipe of an
organ we could see now that the statu on the top of each was the size
of a larg man though they all look like doll from the street we
could see also that from the insid of each and everi one of these
hollow spire from sixteen to thirtyon beauti marbl statu look
out upon the world below

from the eav to the comb of the roof stretch in endless success
great curv marbl beam like the foreandaft brace of a steamboat
and along each beam from end to end stood up a row of rich carv
flower and fruitseach separ and distinct in kind and over  
speci repres at a littl distanc these row seem to close
togeth like the tie of a railroad track and then the mingl
togeth of the bud and blossom of this marbl garden form a pictur
that is veri charm to the eye

we descend and enter within the church long row of flute
column like huge monument divid the build into broad aisl and
on the figur pavement fell mani a soft blush from the paint window
abov i knew the church was veri larg but i could not fulli
appreci it great size until i notic that the men stand far down
by the altar look like boy and seem to glide rather than walk we
loiter about gaze aloft at the monster window all aglow with
brilliant color scene in the live of the saviour and his follow
some of these pictur are mosaic and so artist are their
thousand particl of tint glass or stone put togeth that the work
has all the smooth and finish of a paint we count sixti pane
of glass in one window and each pane was adorn with one of these
master achiev of genius and patienc

the guid show us a coffeecolor piec of sculptur which he said was
consid to have come from the hand of phidia sinc it was not
possibl that ani other artist of ani epoch could have copi natur
with such faultless accuraci the figur was that of a man without a
skin with everi vein arteri muscl everi fiber and tendon and tissu
of the human frame repres in minut detail it look natur
becaus somehow it look as if it were in pain a skin man would be
like to look that way unless his attent were occupi with some
other matter it was a hideous thing and yet there was a fascin
about it some where i am veri sorri i saw it becaus i shall alway
see it now i shall dream of it sometim i shall dream that it is
rest it cord arm on the bed head and look down on me with it
dead eye i shall dream that it is stretch between the sheet with me
and touch me with it expos muscl and it stringi cold leg

it is hard to forget repuls thing i rememb yet how i ran off from
school onc when i was a boy and then pretti late at night conclud
to climb into the window of my father offic and sleep on a loung
becaus i had a delicaci about go home and get thrash as i lay
on the loung and my eye grew accustom to the dark i fanci i
could see a long duski shapeless thing stretch upon the floor a
cold shiver went through me i turn my face to the wall that did not
answer i was afraid that that thing would creep over and seiz me in
the dark i turn back and stare at it for minut and minutesthey
seem hour it appear to me that the lag moonlight never never
would get to it i turn to the wall and count twenti to pass the
feverish time away i lookedth pale squar was nearer i turn
again and count fiftyit was almost touch it with desper will
i turn again and count one hundr and face about all in a
trembl a white human hand lay in the moonlight such an aw sink
at the heartsuch a sudden gasp for breath i felti cannot tell what
i felt when i recov strength enough i face the wall again but
no boy could have remain so with that mysteri hand behind him i
count again and lookedth most of a nake arm was expos i put my
hand over my eye and count till i could stand it no longer and then
the pallid face of a man was there with the corner of the mouth drawn
down and the eye fix and glassi in death i rais to a sit
postur and glower on that corps till the light crept down the bare
breastlin by lineinch by inchpast the nippleand then it disclos
a ghast stab

i went away from there i do not say that i went away in ani sort of a
hurri but i simpli wentthat is suffici i went out at the window
and i carri the sash along with me i did not need the sash but it
was handier to take it than it was to leav it and so i took it i was
not scare but i was consider agit

when i reach home they whip me but i enjoy it it seem
perfect delight that man had been stab near the offic that
afternoon and they carri him in there to doctor him but he onli live
an hour i have slept in the same room with him often sinc thenin my
dream

now we will descend into the crypt under the grand altar of milan
cathedr and receiv an impress sermon from lip that have been
silent and hand that have been gestureless for three hundr year

the priest stop in a small dungeon and held up his candl this was
the last restingplac of a good man a warmheart unselfish man a
man whose whole life was given to succor the poor encourag the
faintheart visit the sick in reliev distress whenev and
wherev he found it his heart his hand and his purs were alway
open with his stori in one mind he can almost see his benign
counten move calm among the haggard face of milan in the day
when the plagu swept the citi brave where all other were coward full
of compass where piti had been crush out of all other breast by the
instinct of selfpreserv gone mad with terror cheer all pray
with all help all with hand and brain and purs at a time when
parent forsook their children the friend desert the friend and the
brother turn away from the sister while her plead were still
wail in his ear

this was good st charl borromeo bishop of milan the peopl idol
him princ lavish uncount treasur upon him we stood in his
tomb near by was the sarcophagus light by the drip candl the
wall were face with basrelief repres scene in his life done in
massiv silver the priest put on a short white lace garment over his
black robe cross himself bow rever and began to turn a
windlass slowli the sarcophagus separ in two part lengthwis and
the lower part sank down and disclos a coffin of rock crystal as clear
as the atmospher within lay the bodi robe in cost habili
cover with gold embroideri and star with scintil gem the
decay head was black with age the dri skin was drawn tight to the
bone the eye were gone there was a hole in the templ and anoth in
the cheek and the skinni lip were part as in a ghast smile over
this dread face it dust and decay and it mock grin hung a crown
sown thick with flash brilliant and upon the breast lay cross and
crozier of solid gold that were splendid with emerald and diamond

how poor and cheap and trivial these gewgaw seem in presenc of the
solemn the grandeur the aw majesti of death think of milton
shakespear washington stand befor a rever world trick out in
the glass bead the brass earr and tin trumperi of the savag of
the plain

dead bartolomeo preach his pregnant sermon and it burden was you
that worship the vaniti of earthyou that long for world honor
world wealth world famebehold their worth

to us it seem that so good a man so kind a heart so simpl a natur
deserv rest and peac in a grave sacr from the intrus of pri
eye and believ that he himself would have prefer to have it so
but peradventur our wisdom was at fault in this regard

as we came out upon the floor of the church again anoth priest
volunt to show us the treasur of the church

what more the furnitur of the narrow chamber of death we had just
visit weigh six million of franc in ounc and carat alon
without a penni thrown into the account for the cost workmanship
bestow upon them but we follow into a larg room fill with tall
wooden press like wardrob he threw them open and behold the
cargo of crude bullion of the assay offic of nevada fade out of my
memori there were virgin and bishop there abov their natur size
made of solid silver each worth by weight from eight hundr thousand
to two million of franc and bear gem book in their hand worth
eighti thousand there were basrelief that weigh six hundr pound
carv in solid silver crozier and cross and candlestick six and
eight feet high all of virgin gold and brilliant with precious stone
and besid these were all manner of cup and vase and such thing rich
in proport it was an aladdin palac the treasur here by
simpl weight without count workmanship were valu at fifti
million of franc if i could get the custodi of them for a while i
fear me the market price of silver bishop would advanc short on
account of their exceed scarciti in the cathedr of milan

the priest show us two of st paul finger and one of st peter
a bone of juda iscariot it was black and also bone of all the other
discipl a handkerchief in which the saviour had left the impress of
his face among the most precious of the relic were a stone from the
holi sepulchr part of the crown of thorn they have a whole one at
notr dame a fragment of the purpl robe worn by the saviour a nail
from the cross and a pictur of the virgin and child paint by the
verit hand of st luke this is the second of st luke virgin we
have seen onc a year all these holi relic are carri in process
through the street of milan

i like to revel in the dryest detail of the great cathedr the
build is five hundr feet long by one hundr and eighti wide and
the princip steepl is in the neighborhood of four hundr feet high
it has   marbl statu and will have upward of three thousand more
when it is finish in addit it has one thousand five hundr
basrelief it has one hundr and thirtysix spirestwentyon more
are to be ad each spire is surmount by a statu six and a half
feet high everi thing about the church is marbl and all from the
same quarri it was bequeath to the archbishopr for this purpos
centuri ago so noth but the mere workmanship cost still that is
expens the bill foot up six hundr and eightyfour million of
franc thus far consider over a hundr million of dollar and
it is estim that it will take a hundr and twenti year yet to
finish the cathedr it look complet but is far from be so we
saw a new statu put in it nich yesterday alongsid of one which had
been stand these four hundr year they said there are four
staircas lead up to the main steepl each of which cost a hundr
thousand dollar with the four hundr and eight statu which adorn
them marco compioni was the architect who design the wonder
structur more than five hundr year ago and it took him fortysix
year to work out the plan and get it readi to hand over to the
builder he is dead now the build was begun a littl less than
five hundr year ago and the third generat henc will not see it
complet

the build look best by moonlight becaus the older portion of it
be stain with age contrast unpleas with the newer and whiter
portion it seem somewhat too broad for it height but may be
familiar with it might dissip this impress

they say that the cathedr of milan is second onli to st peter at
rome i cannot understand how it can be second to anyth made by human
hand

we bid it goodby nowposs for all time how sure in some
futur day when the memori of it shall have lost it vivid shall we
half believ we have seen it in a wonder dream but never with wake
eye




chapter xix

do you wis zo haut can be 

that was what the guid ask when we were look up at the bronz
hors on the arch of peac it meant do you wish to go up there
i give it as a specimen of guideenglish these are the peopl that make
life a burthen to the tourist their tongu are never still they talk
forev and forev and that is the kind of billingsg they use
inspir itself could hard comprehend them if they would onli show
you a masterpiec of art or a vener tomb or a prisonhous or a
battlefield hallow by touch memori or histor reminisc
or grand tradit and then step asid and hold still for ten minut
and let you think it would not be so bad but they interrupt everi
dream everi pleasant train of thought with their tiresom cackl
sometim when i have been stand befor some cherish old idol of
mine that i rememb year and year ago in pictur in the geographi
at school i have thought i would give a whole world if the human parrot
at my side would sudden perish where he stood and leav me to gaze and
ponder and worship

no we did not wis zo haut can be  we wish to go to la scala the
largest theater in the world i think they call it we did so it was a
larg place seven separ and distinct mass of humanitysix great
circl and a monster parquett

we wish to go to the ambrosian librari and we did that also we saw a
manuscript of virgil with annot in the handwrit of petrarch
the gentleman who love anoth man laura and lavish upon her all
through life a love which was a clear wast of the raw materi it was
sound sentiment but bad judgment it brought both parti fame and
creat a fountain of commiser for them in sentiment breast that
is run yet but who say a word in behalf of poor mr laura i do
not know his other name who glorifi him who bedew him with tear
who write poetri about him nobodi how do you suppos he like the
state of thing that has given the world so much pleasur how did he
enjoy have anoth man follow his wife everi where and make her
name a familiar word in everi garlicextermin mouth in itali with
his sonnet to her preempt eyebrow they got fame and sympathyh
got neither this is a peculiar felicit instanc of what is call
poetic justic it is all veri fine but it doe not chime with my
notion of right it is too onesidedtoo ungener

let the world go on fret about laura and petrarch if it will but as
for me my tear and my lament shall be lavish upon the unsung
defend

we saw also an autograph letter of lucrezia borgia a ladi for whom i
have alway entertain the highest respect on account of her rare
histrion capabl her opul in solid gold goblet made of
gild wood her high distinct as an operat screamer and the
facil with which she could order a sextupl funer and get the
corps readi for it we saw one singl coars yellow hair from
lucrezia head likewis it awok emot but we still live in
this same librari we saw some draw by michael angelo these italian
call him mickel angelo and leonardo da vinci they spell it vinci and
pronounc it vinchi foreign alway spell better than they pronounc
we reserv our opinion of these sketch

in anoth build they show us a fresco repres some lion and
other beast draw chariot and they seem to project so far from the
wall that we took them to be sculptur the artist had shrewd
heighten the delus by paint dust on the creatur back as if
it had fallen there natur and proper smart fellowif it be smart
to deceiv stranger

elsewher we saw a huge roman amphitheatr with it stone seat still in
good preserv modern it is now the scene of more peac
recreat than the exhibit of a parti of wild beast with christian
for dinner part of the time the milanes use it for a race track and
at other season they flood it with water and have spirit yacht
regatta there the guid told us these thing and he would hard tri
so hazard an experi as the tell of a falsehood when it is all
he can do to speak the truth in english without get the lockjaw

in anoth place we were shown a sort of summer arbor with a fenc
befor it we said that was noth we look again and saw through
the arbor an endless stretch of garden and shrubberi and grassi lawn
we were perfect will to go in there and rest but it could not be
done it was onli anoth delusiona paint by some ingeni artist
with littl chariti in his heart for tire folk the decept was
perfect no one could have imagin the park was not real we even
thought we smell the flower at first

we got a carriag at twilight and drove in the shade avenu with the
other nobil and after dinner we took wine and ice in a fine garden
with the great public the music was excel the flower and
shrubberi were pleasant to the eye the scene was vivaci everybodi
was genteel and wellbehav and the ladi were slight moustach
and handsom dress but veri home

we adjourn to a cafe and play billiard an hour and i made six or
seven point by the doctor pocket his ball and he made as mani by my
pocket my ball we came near make a carom sometim but not the
one we were tri to make the tabl was of the usual european style
cushion dead and twice as high as the ball the cue in bad repair
the nativ play onli a sort of pool on them we have never seen ani
bodi play the french threebal game yet and i doubt if there is ani
such game known in franc or that there live ani man mad enough to tri
to play it on one of these european tabl we had to stop play
final becaus dan got to sleep fifteen minut between the count
and pay no attent to his mark

afterward we walk up and down one of the most popular street for some
time enjoy other peopl comfort and wish we could export some of
it to our restless drive vitalityconsum mart at home just in
this one matter lie the main charm of life in europecomfort in
america we hurrywhich is well but when the day work is done we go
on think of loss and gain we plan for the morrow we even carri
our busi care to bed with us and toss and worri over them when we
ought to be restor our rack bodi and brain with sleep we burn
up our energi with these excit and either die earli or drop into
a lean and mean old age at a time of life which they call a man prime
in europ when an acr of ground has produc long and well we let it
lie fallow and rest for a season we take no man clear across the
contin in the same coach he start inth coach is stabl somewher
on the plain and it heat machineri allow to cool for a few day
when a razor has seen long servic and refus to hold an edg the
barber lay it away for a few week and the edg come back of it own
accord we bestow thought care upon inanim object but none upon
ourselv what a robust peopl what a nation of thinker we might be
if we would onli lay ourselv on the shelf occasion and renew our
edg

i do envi these european the comfort they take when the work of the
day is done they forget it some of them go with wife and children to
a beer hall and sit quiet and genteelli drink a mug or two of ale
and listen to music other walk the street other drive in the
avenu other assembl in the great ornament squar in the earli
even to enjoy the sight and the fragranc of flower and to hear the
militari band playno european citi be without it fine militari
music at eventid and yet other of the populac sit in the open air in
front of the refresh hous and eat ice and drink mild beverag
that could not harm a child they go to bed moder earli and sleep
well they are alway quiet alway order alway cheer
comfort and appreci of life and it manifold bless one
never see a drunken man among them the chang that has come over our
littl parti is surpris day by day we lose some of our restless
and absorb some of the spirit of quietud and eas that is in the
tranquil atmospher about us and in the demeanor of the peopl we grow
wise apac we begin to comprehend what life is for

we have had a bath in milan in a public bathhous they were go to
put all three of us in one bathtub but we object each of us had an
italian farm on his back we could have felt affluent if we had been
offici survey and fenc in we chose to have three bathtub and
larg onestub suit to the digniti of aristocrat who had real
estat and brought it with them after we were strip and had taken
the first chilli dash we discov that haunt atroc that has
embitt our live in so mani citi and villag of itali and franc
there was no soap i call a woman answer and i bare had time to
throw myself against the doorsh would have been in in anoth second
i said

bewar woman go away from herego away now or it will be the wors
for you i am an unprotect male but i will preserv my honor at the
peril of my life 

these word must have frighten her for she skurri away veri fast

dan voic rose on the air

oh bring some soap whi dont you 

the repli was italian dan resum

soap you knowsoap that is what i wantsoap soap soap
sop soap soup soap hurri up i dont know how you irish spell
it but i want it spell it to suit yourself but fetch it im freez 

i heard the doctor say impress

dan how often have we told you that these foreign cannot understand
english whi will you not depend upon us whi will you not tell us what
you want and let us ask for it in the languag of the countri it would
save us a great deal of the humili your reprehens ignor
caus us i will address this person in his mother tongu here
cospetto corpo di bacco sacramento solferino soap you son of a
gun  dan if you would let us talk for you you would never expos your
ignor vulgar 

even this fluent discharg of italian did not bring the soap at onc but
there was a good reason for it there was not such an articl about the
establish it is my belief that there never had been they had to
send far up town and to sever differ place befor they final got
it so they said we had to wait twenti or thirti minut the same
thing had occur the even befor at the hotel i think i have
divin the reason for this state of thing at last the english know
how to travel comfort and they carri soap with them other
foreign do not use the articl

at everi hotel we stop at we alway have to send out for soap at the
last moment when we are groom ourselv for dinner and they put it
in the bill along with the candl and other nonsens in marseill
they make half the fanci toilet soap we consum in america but the
marseillais onli have a vagu theoret idea of it use which they
have obtain from book of travel just as they have acquir an
uncertain notion of clean shirt and the peculiar of the gorilla
and other curious matter this remind me of poor blucher note to the
landlord in pari

pari le  juillet monsieur le landlordsir pourquoi dont you
mettez some savon in your bedchamb estc que vous pensez i
will steal it la nuit passe you charg me pour deux chandell
when i onli had one hier vous avez charg me avec glace when i had
none at all tout les jour you are come some fresh game or other
on me mai vous ne pouvez pas play this savon dodg on me twice
savon is a necessari de la vie to ani bodi but a frenchman et je
laurai hor de cet hotel or make troubl you hear me allon
blucher

i remonstr against the send of this note becaus it was so mix
up that the landlord would never be abl to make head or tail of it but
blucher said he guess the old man could read the french of it and
averag the rest

blucher french is bad enough but it is not much wors than the english
one find in advertis all over itali everi day for instanc
observ the print card of the hotel we shall probabl stop at on the
shore of lake como

notish 

this hotel which the best it is in itali and most superb is
handsom locat on the best situat of the lake with the most
splendid view near the villa melzi to the king of belgian and
serbelloni this hotel have recent enlarg do offer all
commod on moder price at the stranger gentlemen who whish
spend the season on the lake come 

how is that for a specimen in the hotel is a handsom littl chapel
where an english clergyman is employ to preach to such of the guest of
the hous as hail from england and america and this fact is also set
forth in barbar english in the same advertis wouldnt you have
suppos that the adventur linguist who frame the card would have
known enough to submit it to that clergyman befor he sent it to the
printer

here in milan in an ancient tumbledown ruin of a church is the
mourn wreck of the most celebr paint in the worldth last
supper  by leonardo da vinci we are not infal judg of pictur
but of cours we went there to see this wonder paint onc so
beauti alway so worship by master in art and forev to be
famous in song and stori and the first thing that occur was the
inflict on us of a placard fair reek with wretch english take
a morsel of it bartholomew that is the first figur on the left hand
side at the spectat uncertain and doubt about what he think to
have heard and upon which he want to be assur by himself at christ
and by no other 

good isnt it and then peter is describ as argument in a
threaten and angrili condit at juda iscariot 

this paragraph recal the pictur the last supper is paint on the
dilapid wall of what was a littl chapel attach to the main church
in ancient time i suppos it is batter and scar in everi
direct and stain and discolor by time and napoleon hors
kick the leg off most the discipl when they the hors not the
discipl were stabl there more than half a centuri ago

i recogn the old pictur in a momentth saviour with bow head
seat at the centr of a long rough tabl with scatter fruit and
dish upon it and six discipl on either side in their long robe
talk to each otherth pictur from which all engrav and all
copi have been made for three centuri perhap no live man has
ever known an attempt to paint the lord supper differ the world
seem to have becom settl in the belief long ago that it is not
possibl for human genius to outdo this creation of da vinci i
suppos painter will go on copi it as long as ani of the origin is
left visibl to the eye there were a dozen easel in the room and as
mani artist transfer the great pictur to their canvas fifti
proof of steel engrav and lithograph were scatter around too
and as usual i could not help notic how superior the copi were to
the origin that is to my inexperienc eye wherev you find a
raphael a ruben a michelangelo a carracci or a da vinci and we see
them everi day you find artist copi them and the copi are alway
the handsomest mayb the origin were handsom when they were new
but they are not now

this pictur is about thirti feet long and ten or twelv high i should
think and the figur are at least life size it is one of the largest
paint in europ

the color are dim with age the counten are scale and mar
and near all express is gone from them the hair is a dead blur upon
the wall and there is no life in the eye onli the attitud are
certain

peopl come here from all part of the world and glorifi this
masterpiec they stand entranc befor it with bate breath and part
lip and when they speak it is onli in the catchi ejacul of
raptur

oh wonder 

such express 

such grace of attitud 

such digniti 

such faultless draw 

such matchless color 

such feel 

what delicaci of touch 

what sublim of concept 

a vision a vision 

i onli envi these peopl i envi them their honest admir if it be
honesttheir delight if they feel delight i harbor no animos
toward ani of them but at the same time the thought will intrud itself
upon me how can they see what is not visibl what would you think of a
man who look at some decay blind toothless pockmark cleopatra
and said what matchless beauti what soul what express  what
would you think of a man who gaze upon a dingi foggi sunset and said
what sublim what feel what rich of color  what would
you think of a man who stare in ecstasi upon a desert of stump and
said oh my soul my beat heart what a nobl forest is here 

you would think that those men had an astonish talent for see
thing that had alreadi pass away it was what i thought when i stood
befor the last supper and heard men apostroph wonder and
beauti and perfect which had fade out of the pictur and gone a
hundr year befor they were born we can imagin the beauti that was
onc in an age face we can imagin the forest if we see the stump but
we can not absolut see these thing when they are not there i am
will to believ that the eye of the practic artist can rest upon the
last supper and renew a lustr where onli a hint of it is left suppli a
tint that has fade away restor an express that is gone patch and
color and add to the dull canva until at last it figur shall stand
befor him aglow with the life the feel the fresh yea with all
the nobl beauti that was their when first they came from the hand of
the master but i can not work this miracl can those other uninspir
visitor do it or do they onli happili imagin they do

after read so much about it i am satisfi that the last supper was a
veri miracl of art onc but it was three hundr year ago

it vex me to hear peopl talk so glibli of feel  express 
tone  and those other easili acquir and inexpens technic of
art that make such a fine show in convers concern pictur
there is not one man in seventyf hundr that can tell what a
pictur face is intend to express there is not one man in five
hundr that can go into a courtroom and be sure that he will not
mistak some harmless innoc of a juryman for the blackheart
assassin on trial yet such peopl talk of character and presum to
interpret expression in pictur there is an old stori that matthew
the actor was onc laud the abil of the human face to express the
passion and emot hidden in the breast he said the counten
could disclos what was pass in the heart plainer than the tongu
could

now  he said observ my facewhat doe it express 

despair 

bah it express peac resign what doe this express 

rage 

stuff it mean terror this 

imbecil 

fool it is smother feroc now this 

joy 

oh perdit ani ass can see it mean insan 

express peopl coolli pretend to read it who would think themselv
presumptu if they pretend to interpret the hieroglyph on the
obelisk of luxoryet they are fulli as compet to do the one thing as
the other i have heard two veri intellig critic speak of murillo
immacul concept now in the museum at sevill within the past few
day one said

oh the virgin face is full of the ecstasi of a joy that is complet
that leav noth more to be desir on earth 

the other said

ah that wonder face is so humbl so pleadingit say as plain as
word could say it i fear i trembl i am unworthi but thi will be
done sustain thou thi servant 

the reader can see the pictur in ani drawingroom it can be easili
recogn the virgin the onli young and realli beauti virgin that
was ever paint by one of the old master some of us think stand in
the crescent of the new moon with a multitud of cherub hover about
her and more come her hand are cross upon her breast and upon her
uplift counten fall a glori out of the heaven the reader may
amus himself if he choos in tri to determin which of these
gentlemen read the virgin expression aright or if either of them did
it

ani one who is acquaint with the old master will comprehend how much
the last supper is damag when i say that the spectat can not realli
tell now whether the discipl are hebrew or italian these ancient
painter never succeed in denation themselv the italian
artist paint italian virgin the dutch paint dutch virgin the
virgin of the french painter were frenchwomennon of them ever put
into the face of the madonna that indescrib someth which proclaim
the jewess whether you find her in new york in constantinopl in
pari jerusalem or in the empir of morocco i saw in the sandwich
island onc a pictur copi by a talent german artist from an
engrav in one of the american illustr paper it was an allegori
repres mr davi in the act of sign a secess act or some such
document over him hover the ghost of washington in warn attitud
and in the background a troop of shadowi soldier in continent uniform
were limp with shoeless bandag feet through a drive snowstorm
valley forg was suggest of cours the copi seem accur and yet
there was a discrep somewher after a long examin i discov
what it wasth shadowi soldier were all german jeff davi was a
german even the hover ghost was a german ghost the artist had
unconsci work his nation into the pictur to tell the
truth i am get a littl perplex about john the baptist and his
portrait in franc i final grew reconcil to him as a frenchman
here he is unquestion an italian what next can it be possibl
that the painter make john the baptist a spaniard in madrid and an
irishman in dublin

we took an open barouch and drove two mile out of milan to see ze
echo  as the guid express it the road was smooth it was border
by tree field and grassi meadow and the soft air was fill with
the odor of flower troop of picturesqu peasant girl come from
work hoot at us shout at us made all manner of game of us and
entir delight me my longcherish judgment was confirm i
alway did think those frowsi romant unwash peasant girl i had
read so much about in poetri were a glare fraud

we enjoy our jaunt it was an exhilar relief from tiresom
sightse

we distress ourselv veri littl about the astonish echo the guid
talk so much about we were grow accustom to encomium on wonder
that too often prove no wonder at all and so we were most happili
disappoint to find in the sequel that the guid had even fail to rise
to the magnitud of his subject

we arriv at a tumbledown old rookeri call the palazzo simonettia
massiv hewnston affair occupi by a famili of rag italian
a goodlook young girl conduct us to a window on the second floor
which look out on a court wall on three side by tall build she
put her head out at the window and shout the echo answer more time
than we could count she took a speak trumpet and through it she
shout sharp and quick a singl ha  the echo answer

ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haaaaa  and final went off
into a rollick convuls of the jolliest laughter that could be
imagin it was so joyfulso long continuedso perfect cordial and
hearti that everi bodi was forc to join in there was no resist
it

then the girl took a gun and fire it we stood readi to count the
astonish clatter of reverber we could not say one two three
fast enough but we could dot our notebook with our pencil point almost
rapid enough to take down a sort of shorthand report of the result
my page reveal the follow account i could not keep up but i did
as well as i could

i set down fiftytwo distinct repetit and then the echo got the
advantag of me the doctor set down sixtyfour and thenceforth the
echo move too fast for him also after the separ concuss could
no longer be note the reverber dwindl to a wild longsustain
clatter of sound such as a watchman rattl produc it is like
that this is the most remark echo in the world

the doctor in jest offer to kiss the young girl and was taken a
littl aback when she said he might for a franc the commonest gallantri
compel him to stand by his offer and so he paid the franc and took
the kiss she was a philosoph she said a franc was a good thing to
have and she did not care ani thing for one paltri kiss becaus she had
a million left then our comrad alway a shrewd businessman offer
to take the whole cargo at thirti day but that littl financi scheme
was a failur




chapter xx

we left milan by rail the cathedr six or seven mile behind us vast
dreami bluish snowclad mountain twenti mile in front of us these
were the accent point in the sceneri the more immedi sceneri
consist of field and farmhous outsid the car and a monsterhead
dwarf and a moustach woman insid it these latter were not

we pass through a rang of wild picturesqu hill steep wood
coneshap with rug crag project here and there and with
dwell and ruinous castl perch away up toward the drift cloud
we lunch at the curious old town of como at the foot of the lake and
then took the small steamer and had an afternoon pleasur excurs to
this place bellaggio

when we walk ashor a parti of policemen peopl whose cock hat and
showi uniform would shame the finest uniform in the militari servic of
the unit state put us into a littl stone cell and lock us in we
had the whole passeng list for compani but their room would have been
prefer for there was no light there were no window no
ventil it was close and hot we were much crowd it was the
black hole of calcutta on a small scale present a smoke rose about
our feeta smoke that smell of all the dead thing of earth of all
the putrefact and corrupt imagin

we were there five minut and when we got out it was hard to tell which
of us carri the vilest fragranc

these miser outcast call that fumigating us and the term was a
tame one inde they fumig us to guard themselv against the
cholera though we hail from no infect port we had left the cholera
far behind us all the time howev they must keep epidem away
somehow or other and fumig is cheaper than soap they must either
wash themselv or fumig other peopl some of the lower class had
rather die than wash but the fumig of stranger caus them no
pang they need no fumig themselv their habit make it
unnecessari they carri their prevent with them they sweat and

organgrind

our hotel sit at the water edgeat least it front garden doesand
we walk among the shrubberi and smoke at twilight we look afar off at
switzerland and the alp and feel an indol willing to look no
closer we go down the step and swim in the lake we take a shape
littl boat and sail abroad among the reflect of the star lie on
the thwart and listen to the distant laughter the sing the soft
melodi of flute and guitar that come float across the water from
pleasur gondola we close the even with exasper billiard on
one of those same old execr tabl a midnight luncheon in our ampl
bedchamb a final smoke in it contract veranda face the water
the garden and the mountain a sum up of the day event then
to bed with drowsi brain harass with a mad panorama that mix up
pictur of franc of itali of the ship of the ocean of home in
grotesqu and bewild disord then a melt away of familiar
face of citi and of toss wave into a great calm of
forget and peac

after which the nightmar

breakfast in the morn and then the lake

i did not like it yesterday i thought lake taho was much finer
i have to confess now howev that my judgment er somewhat though
not extravag i alway had an idea that como was a vast basin of
water like taho shut in by great mountain well the border of huge
mountain is here but the lake itself is not a basin it is as crook
as ani brook and onli from onequart to twothird as wide as the
mississippi there is not a yard of low ground on either side of it
noth but endless chain of mountain that spring abrupt from the
water edg and tower to altitud vari from a thousand to two
thousand feet their craggi side are cloth with veget and white
speck of hous peep out from the luxuri foliag everywher they are
even perch upon jut and picturesqu pinnacl a thousand feet abov
your head

again for mile along the shore handsom countri seat surround by
garden and grove sit fair in the water sometim in nook carv by
natur out of the vinehung precipic and with no ingress or egress
save by boat some have great broad stone staircas lead down to
the water with heavi stone balustrad ornament with statuari and
fanci adorn with creep vine and brightcolor flowersfor
all the world like a drop curtain in a theatr and lack noth but
longwaist highheel women and plume gallant in silken tight

a great featur of como attract is the multitud of pretti
hous and garden that cluster upon it shore and on it mountain
side they look so snug and so homelik and at eventid when everi
thing seem to slumber and the music of the vesper bell come steal
over the water one almost believ that nowher els than on the lake of
como can there be found such a paradis of tranquil repos

from my window here in bellaggio i have a view of the other side of the
lake now which is as beauti as a pictur a scar and wrinkl
precipic rise to a height of eighteen hundr feet on a tini bench
half way up it vast wall sit a littl snowflak of a church no bigger
than a martinbox appar skirt the base of the cliff are a
hundr orang grove and garden fleck with glimps of the white
dwell that are buri in them in front three or four gondola lie
idl upon the waterand in the burnish mirror of the lake mountain
chapel hous grove and boat are counterfeit so bright and so
clear that one scarc know where the realiti leav off and the
reflect begin

the surround of this pictur are fine a mile away a groveplum
promontori jut far into the lake and glass it palac in the blue
depth in midstream a boat is cut the shine surfac and leav a
long track behind like a ray of light the mountain beyond are veil
in a dreami purpl haze far in the opposit direct a tumbl mass of
dome and verdant slope and valley bar the lake and here inde doe
distanc lend enchant to the viewfor on this broad canva sun and
cloud and the richest of atmospher have blend a thousand tint
togeth and over it surfac the filmi light and shadow drift hour
after hour and glorifi it with a beauti that seem reflect out of
heaven itself beyond all question this is the most voluptu scene we
have yet look upon

last night the sceneri was strike and picturesqu on the other side
crag and tree and snowi hous were reflect in the lake with a
wonder distinct and stream of light from mani a distant window
shot far abroad over the still water on this side near at hand great
mansion white with moonlight glare out from the midst of mass of
foliag that lay black and shapeless in the shadow that fell from the
cliff aboveand down in the margin of the lake everi featur of the
weird vision was faith repeat

today we have idl through a wonder of a garden attach to a ducal
estatebut enough of descript is enough i judg

i suspect that this was the same place the garden son deceiv the
ladi of lyon with but i do not know you may have heard of the passag
somewher

a deep vale
shut out by alpin hill from the rude world
near a clear lake margin by fruit of gold
and whisper myrtl
glass softest sky cloudless
save with rare and roseat shadow
a palac lift to etern heaven it marbl wall
from out a glossi bower of coolest foliag music with bird 

that is all veri well except the clear part of the lake it certain
is clearer than a great mani lake but how dull it water are compar
with the wonder transpar of lake taho i speak of the north
shore of taho where one can count the scale on a trout at a depth of a
hundr and eighti feet i have tri to get this statement off at par
here but with no success so i have been oblig to negoti it at
fifti percent discount at this rate i find some taker perhap the
reader will receiv it on the same termsnineti feet instead of one
hundr and eighti but let it be rememb that those are forc
termssheriff sale price as far as i am privat concern i
abat not a jot of the origin assert that in those strang
magnifi water one may count the scale on a trout a trout of the
larg kind at a depth of a hundr and eighti feetmay see everi
pebbl on the bottommight even count a paper of draypin peopl talk
of the transpar water of the mexican bay of acapulco but in my own
experi i know they cannot compar with those i am speak of i
have fish for trout in taho and at a measur depth of eightyfour
feet i have seen them put their nose to the bait and i could see their
gill open and shut i could hard have seen the trout themselv at
that distanc in the open air

as i go back in spirit and recal that nobl sea repos among the
snowpeak six thousand feet abov the ocean the convict come strong
upon me again that como would onli seem a bedizen littl courtier in
that august presenc

sorrow and misfortun overtak the legislatur that still from year to
year permit taho to retain it unmus cognomen taho it suggest
no crystal water no picturesqu shore no sublim taho for a sea
in the cloud a sea that has charact and assert it in solemn calm at
time at time in savag storm a sea whose royal seclus is guard
by a cordon of sentinel peak that lift their frosti front nine thousand
feet abov the level world a sea whose everi aspect is impress whose
belong are all beauti whose lone majesti type the deiti

taho mean grasshopp it mean grasshopp soup it is indian and
suggest of indian they say it is piuteposs it is digger
i am satisfi it was name by the diggersthos degrad savag who
roast their dead relat then mix the human greas and ash of bone
with tar and gaum it thick all over their head and forehead and
ear and go caterwaul about the hill and call it mourn these
are the gentri that name the lake

peopl say that taho mean silver lakelimpid waterfal
leaf  bosh it mean grasshopp soup the favorit dish of the digger
tribe and of the piut as well it isnt worth while in these
practic time for peopl to talk about indian poetryther never was
ani in themexcept in the fenimor cooper indian but they are an
extinct tribe that never exist i know the nobl red man i have
camp with the indian i have been on the warpath with them taken part
in the chase with themfor grasshopp help them steal cattl i
have roam with them scalp them had them for breakfast i would
glad eat the whole race if i had a chanc

but i am grow unreli i will return to my comparison of the
lake como is a littl deeper than taho if peopl here tell the
truth they say it is eighteen hundr feet deep at this point but it
doe not look a dead enough blue for that taho is one thousand five
hundr and twentyf feet deep in the centr by the state geologist
measur they say the great peak opposit this town is five thousand
feet high but i feel sure that three thousand feet of that statement is
a good honest lie the lake is a mile wide here and maintain about
that width from this point to it northern extremitywhich is distant
sixteen mile from here to it southern extremitysay fifteen milesit
is not over half a mile wide in ani place i should think it snowclad
mountain one hear so much about are onli seen occasion and then in
the distanc the alp taho is from ten to eighteen mile wide and
it mountain shut it in like a wall their summit are never free from
snow the year round one thing about it is veri strang it never has
even a skim of ice upon it surfac although lake in the same rang of
mountain lie in a lower and warmer temperatur freez over in
winter

chapter xxi

we voyag by steamer down the lago di lecco through wild mountain
sceneri and by hamlet and villa and disembark at the town of lecco
they said it was two hour by carriag to the ancient citi of bergamo
and that we would arriv there in good season for the railway train we
got an open barouch and a wild boister driver and set out it was
delight we had a fast team and a perfect smooth road there were
tower cliff on our left and the pretti lago di lecco on our right
and everi now and then it rain on us just befor start the driver
pick up in the street a stump of a cigar an inch long and put it in
his mouth when he had carri it thus about an hour i thought it would
be onli christian chariti to give him a light i hand him my cigar
which i had just lit and he put it in his mouth and return his stump
to his pocket i never saw a more sociabl man at least i never saw a
man who was more sociabl on a short acquaint

we saw interior itali now the hous were of solid stone and not
often in good repair the peasant and their children were idl as a
general thing and the donkey and chicken made themselv at home in
drawingroom and bedchamb and were not molest the driver of each
and everi one of the slowmov marketcart we met were stretch in
the sun upon their merchandis sound a sleep everi three or four
hundr yard it seem to me we came upon the shrine of some saint or
othera rude pictur of him built into a huge cross or a stone pillar by
the roadsid some of the pictur of the saviour were curios in
their way they repres him stretch upon the cross his
counten distort with agoni from the wound of the crown of
thorn from the pierc side from the mutil hand and feet from
the scourg bodyfrom everi handbreadth of his person stream of blood
were flow such a gori ghast spectacl would frighten the children
out of their sens i should think there were some uniqu auxiliari
to the paint which ad to it spirit effect these were genuin
wooden and iron implement and were promin dispos round about the
figur a bundl of nail the hammer to drive them the spong the reed
that support it the cup of vinegar the ladder for the ascent of the
cross the spear that pierc the saviour side the crown of thorn
was made of real thorn and was nail to the sacr head in some
italian churchpaint even by the old master the saviour and the
virgin wear silver or gild crown that are fasten to the pictur
head with nail the effect is as grotesqu as it is incongru

here and there on the front of roadsid inn we found huge coars
fresco of suffer martyr like those in the shrine it could not
have diminish their suffer ani to be so uncouth repres
we were in the heart and home of priest craftof a happi cheer

the highest window in the ruin tower

chapter xxii

this venic which was a haughti invinc magnific republ for
near fourteen hundr year whose armi compel the world
applaus whenev and wherev they battl whose navi well nigh held
dominion of the sea and whose merchant fleet whiten the remotest
ocean with their sail and load these pier with the product of everi
clime is fallen a prey to poverti neglect and melancholi decay six
hundr year ago venic was the autocrat of commerc her mart was the
great commerci centr the distributinghous from whenc the enorm
trade of the orient was spread abroad over the western world today her
pier are desert her warehous are empti her merchant fleet are
vanish her armi and her navi are but memori her glori is
depart and with her crumbl grandeur of wharv and palac about
her she sit among her stagnant lagoon forlorn and beggar forgotten
of the world she that in her palmi day command the commerc of a
hemispher and made the weal or woe of nation with a beck of her
puissant finger is becom the humblest among the peopl of the earth
a peddler of glass bead for women and trifl toy and trinket for
schoolgirl and children

the vener mother of the republ is scarc a fit subject for
flippant speech or the idl gossip of tourist it seem a sort of
sacrileg to disturb the glamour of old romanc that pictur her to us
soft from afar off as through a tint mist and curtain her ruin and
her desol from our view one ought inde to turn away from her
rag her poverti and her humili and think of her onli as she was
when she sunk the fleet of charlemagn when she humbl frederick
barbarossa or wave her victori banner abov the battlement of
constantinopl

we reach venic at eight in the even and enter a hears belong
to the grand hotel deurop at ani rate it was more like a hears than
ani thing els though to speak by the card it was a gondola and this
was the stori gondola of venic the fairi boat in which the princ
cavali of the olden time were wont to cleav the water of the moonlit
canal and look the eloqu of love into the soft eye of patrician
beauti while the gay gondoli in silken doublet touch his guitar
and sang as onli gondoli can sing this the fame gondola and this
the gorgeous gondoli the one an inki rusti old cano with a sabl
hearsebodi clap on to the middl of it and the other a mangi
barefoot guttersnip with a portion of his raiment on exhibit which
should have been sacr from public scrutini present as he turn a
corner and shot his hears into a dismal ditch between two long row of
tower unten build the gay gondoli began to sing true to
the tradit of his race i stood it a littl while then i said

now here roderigo gonzal michael angelo im a pilgrim and im a
stranger but i am not go to have my feel lacer by ani such
caterwaul as that if that goe on one of us has got to take water
it is enough that my cherish dream of venic have been blight
forev as to the romant gondola and the gorgeous gondoli this
system of destruct shall go no farther i will accept the hears
under protest and you may fli your flag of truce in peac but here i
regist a dark and bloodi oath that you shant sing anoth yelp and
overboard you go 

i began to feel that the old venic of song and stori had depart
forev but i was too hasti in a few minut we swept grace out
into the grand canal and under the mellow moonlight the venic of poetri
and romanc stood reveal right from the water edg rose long line
of state palac of marbl gondola were glide swift hither and
thither and disappear sudden through unsuspect gate and alley
ponder stone bridg threw their shadow athwart the glitter wave
there was life and motion everywher and yet everywher there was a
hush a stealthi sort of still that was suggest of secret
enterpris of bravo and of lover and clad half in moonbeam and half
in mysteri shadow the grim old mansion of the republ seem to
have an express about them of have an eye out for just such
enterpris as these at that same moment music came float over the
watersvenic was complet

it was a beauti pictureveri soft and dreami and beauti but what
was this venic to compar with the venic of midnight noth there
was a fetea grand fete in honor of some saint who had been instrument
in check the cholera three hundr year ago and all venic was
abroad on the water it was no common affair for the venetian did not
know how soon they might need the saint servic again now that the
cholera was spread everi where so in one vast spacesay a third of
a mile wide and two mile longwer collect two thousand gondola and
everi one of them had from two to ten twenti and even thirti color
lantern suspend about it and from four to a dozen occup just as
far as the eye could reach these paint light were mass togeth
like a vast garden of manycolor flower except that these blossom
were never still they were ceaseless glide in and out and mingl
togeth and seduc you into bewild attempt to follow their mazi
evolut here and there a strong red green or blue glare from a
rocket that was struggl to get away splendid illumin all the
boat around it everi gondola that swam by us with it crescent and
pyramid and circl of color lamp hung aloft and light up the
face of the young and the sweetscent and love below was a pictur
and the reflect of those light so long so slender so numberless
so manycolor and so distort and wrinkl by the wave was a pictur
likewis and one that was enchant beauti mani and mani a parti
of young ladi and gentlemen had their state gondola handsom
decor and ate supper on board bring their swallowtail
whitecravat varlet to wait upon them and have their tabl
trick out as if for a bridal supper they had brought along the
cost globe lamp from their drawingroom and the lace and silken
curtain from the same place i suppos and they had also brought
piano and guitar and they play and sang opera while the plebeian
paperlantern gondola from the suburb and the back alley crowd
around to stare and listen

there was music everi wherechorus string band brass band flute
everi thing i was so surround wall in with music magnific
and loveli that i becam inspir with the spirit of the scene and
sang one tune myself howev when i observ that the other gondola
had sail away and my gondoli was prepar to go overboard i
stop

the fete was magnific they kept it up the whole night long and i
never enjoy myself better than i did while it last

what a funni old citi this queen of the adriat is narrow street
vast gloomi marbl palac black with the corrod damp of centuri
and all part submerg no dri land visibl ani where and no sidewalk
worth mention if you want to go to church to the theatr or to the
restaur you must call a gondola it must be a paradis for crippl
for verili a man has no use for leg here

for a day or two the place look so like an overflow arkansa town
becaus of it currentless water lave the veri doorstep of all the
hous and the cluster of boat made fast under the window or skim
in and out of the alley and byway that i could not get rid of the
impress that there was noth the matter here but a spring freshet
and that the river would fall in a few week and leav a dirti highwat
mark on the hous and the street full of mud and rubbish

in the glare of day there is littl poetri about venic but under the
charit moon her stain palac are white again their batter
sculptur are hidden in shadow and the old citi seem crown onc
more with the grandeur that was her five hundr year ago it is easi
then in fanci to peopl these silent canal with plume gallant and
fair ladieswith shylock in gaberdin and sandal ventur loan upon
the rich argosi of venetian commercewith othello and desdemona
with iago and roderigoswith nobl fleet and victori legion
return from the war in the treacher sunlight we see venic
decay forlorn povertystricken and commercelessforgotten and
utter insignific but in the moonlight her fourteen centuri of
great fling their glori about her and onc more is she the
princeliest among the nation of the earth

there is a glorious citi in the sea
the sea is in the broad the narrow street
eb and flow and the saltsea weed
cling to the marbl of her palac
no track of men no footstep to and fro
lead to her gate the path lie oer the sea
invis and from the land we went
as to a float cityst in
and glide up her street as in a dream
so smooth silentlybi mani a dome
mosquelik and mani a state portico
the statu rang along an azur sky
by mani a pile in more than eastern pride
of old the resid of merchant king
the front of some tho time had shatterd them
still glow with the richest hue of art
as tho the wealth within them had run oer 

what would one natur wish to see first in venic the bridg of
sigh of courseand next the church and the great squar of st mark
the bronz hors and the famous lion of st mark

we intend to go to the bridg of sigh but happen into the ducal
palac firsta build which necessarili figur larg in venetian
poetri and tradit in the senat chamber of the ancient republ we
weari our eye with stare at acr of histor paint by
tintoretto and paul verones but noth struck us forcibl except the
one thing that strike all stranger forciblya black squar in the
midst of a galleri of portrait in one long row around the great hall
were paint the portrait of the doge of venic vener fellow
with flow white beard for of the three hundr senat elig to
the offic the oldest was usual chosen doge and each had it
complimentari inscript attachedtil you came to the place that
should have had marino faliero pictur in it and that was blank and
blackblank except that it bore a ters inscript say that the
conspir had die for his crime it seem cruel to keep that
pitiless inscript still stare from the wall after the unhappi
wretch had been in his grave five hundr year

at the head of the giant staircas where marino faliero was behead
and where the doge were crown in ancient time two small slit in the
stone wall were point outtwo harmless insignific orific that
would never attract a stranger attentionyet these were the terribl
lion mouth the head were gone knock off by the french dure
their occup of venic but these were the throat down which went
the anonym accus thrust in secret at dead of night by an
enemi that doom mani an innoc man to walk the bridg of sigh and
descend into the dungeon which none enter and hope to see the sun
again this was in the old day when the patrician alon govern
veniceth common herd had no vote and no voic there were one
thousand five hundr patrician from these three hundr senat were
chosen from the senat a doge and a council of ten were select and
by secret ballot the ten chose from their own number a council of three
all these were govern spi then and everi spi was under
surveil himselfmen spoke in whisper in venic and no man trust
his neighbornot alway his own brother no man knew who the council of
three werenot even the senat not even the doge the member of that
dread tribun met at night in a chamber to themselv mask and robe
from head to foot in scarlet cloak and did not even know each other
unless by voic it was their duti to judg heinous polit crime
and from their sentenc there was no appeal a nod to the execution
was suffici the doom man was march down a hall and out at a
doorway into the cover bridg of sigh through it and into the
dungeon and unto his death at no time in his transit was he visibl to
ani save his conductor if a man had an enemi in those old day the
cleverest thing he could do was to slip a note for the council of three
into the lion mouth say this man is plot against the
govern  if the aw three found no proof ten to one they would
drown him anyhow becaus he was a deep rascal sinc his plot were
unsolv mask judg and mask execution with unlimit power
and no appeal from their judgement in that hard cruel age were not
like to be lenient with men they suspect yet could not convict

we walk through the hall of the council of ten and present enter
the infern den of the council of three

the tabl around which they had sat was there still and likewis the
station where the mask inquisitor and execution former stood
frozen upright and silent till they receiv a bloodi order and then
without a word move off like the inexor machin they were to
carri it out the fresco on the wall were startl suit to the
place in all the other saloon the hall the great state chamber of
the palac the wall and ceil were bright with gild rich with
elabor carv and resplend with gallant pictur of venetian
victori in war and venetian display in foreign court and hallow
with portrait of the virgin the saviour of men and the holi saint
that preach the gospel of peac upon earthbut here in dismal
contrast were none but pictur of death and dread suffer not a
live figur but was writh in tortur not a dead one but was smear
with blood gash with wound and distort with the agoni that had
taken away it life

from the palac to the gloomi prison is but a stepon might almost jump
across the narrow canal that interven the ponder stone bridg of
sigh cross it at the second storya bridg that is a cover tunnel
you can not be seen when you walk in it it is partit lengthwis
and through one compart walk such as bore light sentenc in
ancient time and through the other march sad the wretch whom the
three had doom to linger miseri and utter oblivion in the dungeon
or to sudden and mysteri death down below the level of the water by
the light of smoke torch we were shown the damp thickwal cell
where mani a proud patrician life was eaten away by the longdrawn
miseri of solitari imprisonmentwithout light air book nake
unshaven uncomb cover with vermin his useless tongu forget
it offic with none to speak to the day and night of his life no
longer mark but merg into one etern eventless night far away from
all cheer sound buri in the silenc of a tomb forgotten by his
helpless friend and his fate a dark mysteri to them forev lose his
own memori at last and know no more who he was or how he came there
devour the loaf of bread and drink the water that were thrust into
the cell by unseen hand and troubl his worn spirit no more with
hope and fear and doubt and long to be free ceas to scratch
vain prayer and complain on wall where none not even himself
could see them and resign himself to hopeless apathi drivel
childish lunaci mani and mani a sorrow stori like this these
stoni wall could tell if they could but speak

in a littl narrow corridor near by they show us where mani a
prison after lie in the dungeon until he was forgotten by all save
his persecutor was brought by mask execution and garrot or
sew up in a sack pass through a littl window to a boat at dead of
night and taken to some remot spot and drown

they use to show to visitor the implement of tortur wherewith the
three were wont to worm secret out of the accusedvillain machin
for crush thumb the stock where a prison sat immov while
water fell drop by drop upon his head till the tortur was more than
human could bear and a devilish contriv of steel which inclos
a prison head like a shell and crush it slowli by mean of a
screw it bore the stain of blood that had trickl through it joint
long ago and on one side it had a project whereon the tortur rest
his elbow comfort and bent down his ear to catch the moan of the
suffer perish within

of cours we went to see the vener relic of the ancient glori of
venic with it pavement worn and broken by the pass feet of a
thousand year of plebeian and patriciansth cathedr of st mark
it is built entir of precious marbl brought from the orient
noth in it composit is domest it hoari tradit make it an
object of absorb interest to even the most careless stranger and thus
far it had interest for me but no further i could not go into
ecstasi over it coars mosaic it unlov byzantin architectur
or it five hundr curious interior column from as mani distant
quarri everi thing was worn outeveri block of stone was smooth and
almost shapeless with the polish hand and shoulder of lounger who
devout idl here in bygon centuri and have die and gone to the
devno simpli die i mean

under the altar repos the ash of st markand matthew luke and john
too for all i know venic rever those relic abov all thing
earth for fourteen hundr year st mark has been her patron saint
everi thing about the citi seem to be name after him or so name as to
refer to him in some wayso name or some purchas rig in some way
to scrape a sort of hurrah acquaint with him that seem to be
the idea to be on good term with st mark seem to be the veri summit
of venetian ambit they say st mark had a tame lion and use to
travel with himand everi where that st mark went the lion was sure to
go it was his protector his friend his librarian and so the wing
lion of st mark with the open bibl under his paw is a favorit emblem
in the grand old citi it cast it shadow from the most ancient pillar
in venic in the grand squar of st mark upon the throng of free
citizen below and has so done for mani a long centuri the wing lion
is found everi whereand doubtless here where the wing lion is no
harm can come

st mark die at alexandria in egypt he was martyr i think
howev that has noth to do with my legend about the found of
the citi of venicesay four hundr and fifti year after christ for
venic is much younger than ani other italian citi a priest dream
that an angel told him that until the remain of st mark were brought to
venic the citi could never rise to high distinct among the nation
that the bodi must be captur brought to the citi and a magnific
church built over it and that if ever the venetian allow the saint to
be remov from his new restingplac in that day venic would perish
from off the face of the earth the priest proclaim his dream and
forthwith venic set about procur the corps of st mark one
expedit after anoth tri and fail but the project was never
abandon dure four hundr year at last it was secur by
stratagem in the year eight hundr and someth the command of a
venetian expedit disguis himself stole the bone separ them
and pack them in vessel fill with lard the religion of mahomet
caus it devote to abhor anyth that is in the natur of pork and
so when the christian was stop by the offic at the gate of the
citi they onli glanc onc into his precious basket then turn up
their nose at the unholi lard and let him go the bone were buri in
the vault of the grand cathedr which had been wait long year to
receiv them and thus the safeti and the great of venic were
secur and to this day there be those in venic who believ that if
those holi ash were stolen away the ancient citi would vanish like a
dream and it foundat be buri forev in the unrememb sea




chapter xxiii

the venetian gondola is as free and grace in it glide movement as
a serpent it is twenti or thirti feet long and is narrow and deep
like a cano it sharp bow and stern sweep upward from the water like
the horn of a crescent with the abrupt of the curv slight
modifi

the bow is ornament with a steel comb with a battleax attach which
threaten to cut pass boat in two occasion but never doe the
gondola is paint black becaus in the zenith of venetian magnific
the gondola becam too gorgeous altogeth and the senat decre that
all such display must ceas and a solemn unembellish black be
substitut if the truth were known it would doubtless appear that
rich plebeian grew too promin in their affect of patrician show
on the grand canal and requir a wholesom snub rever for the
hallow past and it tradit keep the dismal fashion in forc now
that the compuls exist no longer so let it remain it is the color
of mourn venic mourn the stern of the boat is deck over and
the gondoli stand there he use a singl oara long blade of
cours for he stand near erect a wooden peg a foot and a half
high with two slight crook or curv in one side of it and one in the
other project abov the starboard gunwal against that peg the
gondoli take a purchas with his oar chang it at interv to the
other side of the peg or drop it into anoth of the crook as the
steer of the craft may demandand how in the world he can back and
fill shoot straight ahead or flirt sudden around a corner and make
the oar stay in those insignific notch is a problem to me and a
never diminish matter of interest i am afraid i studi the
gondoli marvel skill more than i do the sculptur palac we
glide among he cut a corner so close now and then or miss
anoth gondola by such an impercept hairbreadth that i feel myself
scrooch  as the children say just as one doe when a buggi wheel
graze his elbow but he make all his calcul with the nicest
precis and goe dart in and out among a broadway confus of busi
craft with the easi confid of the educ hackman he never make a
mistak

sometim we go fli down the great canal at such a gait that we can
get onli the merest glimps into front door and again in obscur
alley in the suburb we put on a solemn suit to the silenc the
mildew the stagnant water the cling weed the desert hous and
the general lifeless of the place and move to the spirit of grave
medit

the gondoli is a picturesqu rascal for all he wear no satin har
no plume bonnet no silken tight his attitud is state he is lith
and suppl all his movement are full of grace when his long cano
and his fine figur tower from it high perch on the stern are cut
against the even sky they make a pictur that is veri novel and
strike to a foreign eye

we sit in the cushion carriagebodi of a cabin with the curtain
drawn and smoke or read or look out upon the pass boat the
hous the bridg the peopl and enjoy ourselv much more than we
could in a buggi jolt over our cobbleston pavement at home this
is the gentlest pleasantest locomot we have ever known

but it seem queerev so queerto see a boat do duti as a privat
carriag we see busi men come to the front door step into a
gondola instead of a street car and go off down town to the
countingroom

we see visit young ladi stand on the stoop and laugh and kiss
goodby and flirt their fan and say come soonnow doyouv been
just as mean as ever you can bemoth die to see youand wev
move into the new hous o such a love of a place so conveni to the
post offic and the church and the young men christian associ
and we do have such fish and such carri on and such
swimmingmatch in the back yardoh you must comeno distanc at all
and if you go down through by st mark and the bridg of sigh and cut
through the alley and come up by the church of santa maria dei frari and
into the grand canal there isnt a bit of currentnow do come salli
mariabyby  and then the littl humbug trip down the step jump
into the gondola say under her breath disagre old thing i hope
she wont  goe skim away round the corner and the other girl
slam the street door and say well that inflict over ani way
but i suppos iv got to go and see hertiresom stuckup thing 
human natur appear to be just the same all over the world we see the
diffid young man mild of moustach affluent of hair indig of
brain eleg of costum drive up to her father mansion tell his
hackman to bail out and wait start fear up the step and meet the
old gentleman right on the threshold hear him ask what street the new
british bank is ina if that were what he came forand then bounc
into his boat and skurri away with his coward heart in his boot see
him come sneak around the corner again direct with a crack of the
curtain open toward the old gentleman disappear gondola and out
scamper his susan with a flock of littl italian endear flutter
from her lip and goe to drive with him in the wateri avenu down
toward the rialto

we see the ladi go out shop in the most natur way and flit from
street to street and from store to store just in the good old fashion
except that they leav the gondola instead of a privat carriag
wait at the curbston a coupl of hour for them wait while they
make the nice young clerk pull down ton and ton of silk and velvet
and moir antiqu and those thing and then they buy a paper of pin
and go paddl away to confer the rest of their disastr patronag on
some other firm and they alway have their purchas sent home just in
the good old way human natur is veri much the same all over the world
and it is so like my dear nativ home to see a venetian ladi go into a
store and buy ten cent worth of blue ribbon and have it sent home in a
scow ah it is these littl touch of natur that move one to tear in
these faroff foreign land

we see littl girl and boy go out in gondola with their nurs for an
air we see staid famili with prayerbook and bead enter the
gondola dress in their sunday best and float away to church and at
midnight we see the theatr break up and discharg it swarm of hilari
youth and beauti we hear the cri of the hackmangondoli and behold
the struggl crowd jump aboard and the black multitud of boat go
skim down the moonlit avenu we see them separ here and there
and disappear up diverg street we hear the faint sound of laughter
and of shout farewel float up out of the distanc and then the
strang pageant be gone we have lone stretch of glitter water
of state buildingsof blot shadowsof weird stone face
creep into the moonlightof desert bridgesof motionless boat at
anchor and over all brood that mysteri still that stealthi
quiet that befit so well this old dream venic

we have been pretti much everi where in our gondola we have bought
bead and photograph in the store and wax match in the great squar
of st mark the last remark suggest a digress everi bodi goe to
this vast squar in the even the militari band play in the centr
of it and countless coupl of ladi and gentlemen promenad up and down
on either side and platoon of them are constant drift away toward
the old cathedr and by the vener column with the wing lion of
st mark on it top and out to where the boat lie moor and other
platoon are as constant arriv from the gondola and join the
great throng between the promenad and the sidewalk are seat
hundr and hundr of peopl at small tabl smoke and take
granita a first cousin to icecream on the sidewalk are more
employ themselv in the same way the shop in the first floor of
the tall row of build that wall in three side of the squar are
brilliant light the air is fill with music and merri voic and
altogeth the scene is as bright and spirit and full of cheer
as ani man could desir we enjoy it thorough veri mani of the young
women are exceed pretti and dress with rare good tast we are
gradual and labori learn the illmann of stare them
unflinch in the facenot becaus such conduct is agreeabl to us
but becaus it is the custom of the countri and they say the girl like
it we wish to learn all the curious outlandish way of all the
differ countri so that we can show off and astonish peopl when
we get home we wish to excit the envi of our untravel friend with
our strang foreign fashion which we cant shake off all our
passeng are pay strict attent to this thing with the end in
view which i have mention the gentl reader will never never know
what a consumm ass he can becom until he goe abroad i speak now
of cours in the supposit that the gentl reader has not been abroad
and therefor is not alreadi a consumm ass if the case be otherwis
i beg his pardon and extend to him the cordial hand of fellowship and
call him brother i shall alway delight to meet an ass after my own

on this subject let me remark that there are american abroad in itali

think of our whitcomb and our ainsworth and our williams write
themselv down in dilapid french in foreign hotel regist we
laugh at englishmen when we are at home for stick so sturdili to
their nation way and custom but we look back upon it from abroad

to see him make of himself a thing that is neither male nor femal
neither fish flesh nor fowla poor miser hermaphrodit
frenchman

among a long list of church art galleri and such thing visit by
us in venic i shall mention onli oneth church of santa maria dei
frari it is about five hundr year old i believ and stand on
twelv hundr thousand pile in it lie the bodi of canova and the
heart of titian under magnific monument titian die at the age of
almost one hundr year a plagu which swept away fifti thousand live
was rage at the time and there is notabl evid of the rever in
which the great painter was held in the fact that to him alon the state
permit a public funer in all that season of terror and death

in this church also is a monument to the doge foscari whose name a
onc resid of venic lord byron has made perman famous

the monument to the doge giovanni pesaro in this church is a curios
in the way of mortuari adorn it is eighti feet high and is front
like some fantast pagan templ against it stand four coloss
nubian as black as night dress in white marbl garment the black
leg are bare and through rent in sleev and breech the skin of
shini black marbl show the artist was as ingeni as his funer
design were absurd there are two bronz skeleton bear scroll and
two great dragon uphold the sarcophagus on high amid all this
grotesqu sit the depart doge

in the conventu build attach to this church are the state
archiv of venic we did not see them but they are said to number
million of document they are the record of centuri of the most
watch observ and suspici govern that ever existedin which
everi thing was written down and noth spoken out  they fill near
three hundr room among them are manuscript from the archiv of
near two thousand famili monasteri and convent the secret
histori of venic for a thousand year is hereit plot it hidden
trial it assassin it commiss of hirel spi and mask
bravoesfood readi to hand for a world of dark and mysteri
romanc

yes i think we have seen all of venic we have seen in these old
church a profus of cost and elabor sepulchr ornament
such as we never dreampt of befor we have stood in the dim religi
light of these hoari sanctuari in the midst of long rank of dusti
monument and effigi of the great dead of venic until we seem
drift back back back into the solemn past and look upon the
scene and mingl with the peopl of a remot antiqu we have been
in a halfwak sort of dream all the time i do not know how els to
describ the feel a part of our be has remain still in the
nineteenth centuri while anoth part of it has seem in some
unaccount way walk among the phantom of the tenth

we have seen famous pictur until our eye are weari with look at
them and refus to find interest in them ani longer and what wonder
when there are twelv hundr pictur by palma the younger in venic and
fifteen hundr by tintoretto and behold there are titian and the
work of other artist in proport we have seen titian celebr
cain and abel his david and goliah his abraham sacrific we have
seen tintoretto monster pictur which is seventyfour feet long and i
do not know how mani feet high and thought it a veri commodi pictur
we have seen pictur of martyr enough and saint enough to regener
the world i ought not to confess it but still sinc one has no
opportun in america to acquir a critic judgment in art and sinc i
could not hope to becom educ in it in europ in a few short week i
may therefor as well acknowledg with such apolog as may be due that
to me it seem that when i had seen one of these martyr i had seen them
all they all have a mark famili resembl to each other they dress
alik in coars monkish robe and sandal they are all bald head
they all stand in about the same attitud and without except they are
gaze heavenward with counten which the ainsworth the morton and
the williams et fil inform me are full of express  to me there
is noth tangibl about these imaginari portrait noth that i can
grasp and take a live interest in if great titian had onli been
gift with propheci and had skip a martyr and gone over to england
and paint a portrait of shakspear even as a youth which we could all
have confid in now the world down to the latest generat would
have forgiven him the lost martyr in the rescu seer i think poster
could have spare one more martyr for the sake of a great histor
pictur of titian time and paint by his brushsuch as columbus
return in chain from the discoveri of a world for instanc the old
master did paint some venetian histor pictur and these we did not
tire of look at notwithstand represent of the formal
introduct of defunct doge to the virgin mari in region beyond the
cloud clash rather harsh with the proprieti it seem to us

but humbl as we are and unpretend in the matter of art our
research among the paint monk and martyr have not been wholli in
vain we have striven hard to learn we have had some success we have
master some thing possibl of trifl import in the eye of the
learn but to us they give pleasur and we take as much pride in our
littl acquir as do other who have learn far more and we love
to display them full as well when we see a monk go about with a lion
and look tranquilli up to heaven we know that that is st mark when
we see a monk with a book and a pen look tranquilli up to heaven
tri to think of a word we know that that is st matthew when we see
a monk sit on a rock look tranquilli up to heaven with a human
skull besid him and without other baggag we know that that is st
jerom becaus we know that he alway went fli light in the matter
of baggag when we see a parti look tranquilli up to heaven
unconsci that his bodi is shot through and through with arrow we
know that that is st sebastian when we see other monk look
tranquilli up to heaven but have no trademark we alway ask who
those parti are we do this becaus we humbl wish to learn we have
seen thirteen thousand st jerom and twentytwo thousand st mark
and sixteen thousand st matthew and sixti thousand st sebastian and
four million of assort monk undesign and we feel encourag to
believ that when we have seen some more of these various pictur and
had a larger experi we shall begin to take an absorb interest in
them like our cultiv countrymen from ameriqu

now it doe give me real pain to speak in this almost unappreci way
of the old master and their martyr becaus good friend of mine in the
shipfriend who do thorough and conscienti appreci them and
are in everi way compet to discrimin between good pictur and
inferior oneshav urg me for my own sake not to make public the fact
that i lack this appreci and this critic discrimin myself i
believ that what i have written and may still write about pictur will
give them pain and i am honest sorri for it i even promis that i
would hide my uncouth sentiment in my own breast but ala i never
could keep a promis i do not blame myself for this weak becaus
the fault must lie in my physic organ it is like that such a
veri liber amount of space was given to the organ which enabl me to
make promis that the organ which should enabl me to keep them was
crowd out but i griev not i like no halfway thing i had rather
have one faculti nobli develop than two faculti of mere ordinari
capac i certain meant to keep that promis but i find i can not
do it it is imposs to travel through itali without speak of
pictur and can i see them through other eye

if i did not so delight in the grand pictur that are spread befor me
everi day of my life by that monarch of all the old master natur i
should come to believ sometim that i had in me no appreci of
the beauti whatsoev

it seem to me that whenev i glori to think that for onc i have
discov an ancient paint that is beauti and worthi of all
prais the pleasur it give me is an infal proof that it is not a
beauti pictur and not in ani wise worthi of commend this veri
thing has occur more time than i can mention in venic in everi
singl instanc the guid has crush out my swell enthusiasm with the
remark

it is nothingit is of the renaiss 

i did not know what in the mischief the renaiss was and so alway i
had to simpli say

ah so it isi had not observ it befor 

i could not bear to be ignor befor a cultiv negro the offspr
of a south carolina slave but it occur too often for even my
selfcomplac did that exasper it is nothingit is of the
renaiss  i said at last

who is this renaiss where did he come from who gave him
permiss to cram the republ with his execr daub 

we learn then that renaiss was not a man that renaiss was a
term use to signifi what was at best but an imperfect rejuven of
art the guid said that after titian time and the time of the other
great name we had grown so familiar with high art declin then it
partial rose againan inferior sort of painter sprang up and these
shabbi pictur were the work of their hand then i said in my heat
that i wish to good high art had declin five hundr year
sooner  the renaiss pictur suit me veri well though sooth to say
it school were too much given to paint real men and did not indulg
enough in martyr

the guid i have spoken of is the onli one we have had yet who knew ani
thing he was born in south carolina of slave parent they came to
venic while he was an infant he has grown up here he is well
educ he read write and speak english italian spanish and
french with perfect facil is a worshipp of art and thorough
convers with it know the histori of venic by heart and never tire
of talk of her illustri career he dress better than ani of us
i think and is daintili polit negro are deem as good as white
peopl in venic and so this man feel no desir to go back to his
nativ land his judgment is correct

i have had anoth shave i was write in our front room this afternoon
and tri hard to keep my attent on my work and refrain from look
out upon the canal i was resist the soft influenc of the climat
as well as i could and endeavor to overcom the desir to be indol
and happi the boy sent for a barber they ask me if i would be
shave i remind them of my tortur in genoa milan como of my
declar that i would suffer no more on italian soil i said not ani
for me if you pleas 

i wrote on the barber began on the doctor i heard him say

dan this is the easiest shave i have had sinc we left the ship 

he said again present

whi dan a man could go to sleep with this man shave him 

dan took the chair then he said

whi this is titian this is one of the old master 

i wrote on direct dan said

doctor it is perfect luxuri the ship barber isnt ani thing to
him 

my rough beard wee distress me beyond measur the barber was roll
up his apparatus the temptat was too strong i said

hold on pleas shave me also 

i sat down in the chair and close my eye the barber soap my face
and then took his razor and gave me a rake that well nigh threw me into
convuls i jump out of the chair dan and the doctor were both
wipe blood off their face and laugh

i said it was a mean disgrac fraud

they said that the miseri of this shave had gone so far beyond ani thing
they had ever experienc befor that they could not bear the idea of
lose such a chanc of hear a cordial opinion from me on the subject

it was shame but there was no help for it the skin was begun
and had to be finish the tear flow with everi rake and so did the
fervent execr the barber grew confus and brought blood everi
time i think the boy enjoy it better than ani thing they have seen
or heard sinc they left home

we have seen the campanil and byron hous and balbi the geograph
and the palac of all the ancient duke and doge of venic and we have
seen their effemin descend air their nobil in fashion
french attir in the grand squar of st mark and eat ice and
drink cheap wine instead of wear gallant coat of mail and
destroy fleet and armi as their great ancestor did in the day of
venetian glori we have seen no bravo with poison stiletto no
mask no wild carniv but we have seen the ancient pride of venic
the grim bronz hors that figur in a thousand legend venic may
well cherish them for they are the onli hors she ever had it is said
there are hundr of peopl in this curious citi who never have seen a
live hors in their live it is entir true no doubt

and so have satisfi ourselv we depart tomorrow and leav the
vener queen of the republ to summon her vanish ship and
marshal her shadowi armi and know again in dream the pride of her old
renown




chapter xxiv

some of the quaker citi passeng had arriv in venic from
switzerland and other land befor we left there and other were
expect everi day we heard of no casualti among them and no
sick

we were a littl fatigu with sight see and so we rattl through a
good deal of countri by rail without care to stop i took few note
i find no mention of bologna in my memorandum book except that we
arriv there in good season but saw none of the sausag for which the
place is so just celebr

pistoia awok but a pass interest

florenc pleas us for a while i think we appreci the great figur
of david in the grand squar and the sculptur group they call the rape
of the sabin we wander through the endless collect of paint
and statu of the pitti and ufizzi galleri of cours i make that
statement in selfdefens there let it stop i could not rest under the
imput that i visit florenc and did not travers it weari mile
of pictur galleri we tri indol to recollect someth about
the guelph and ghibelin and the other histor cutthroat whose
quarrel and assassin make up so larg a share of florentin
histori but the subject was not attract we had been rob of all
the fine mountain sceneri on our littl journey by a system of
railroad that had three mile of tunnel to a hundr yard of
daylight and we were not inclin to be sociabl with florenc we had
seen the spot outsid the citi somewher where these peopl had allow
the bone of galileo to rest in unconsecr ground for an age becaus
his great discoveri that the world turn around was regard as a
damn heresi by the church and we know that long after the world had
accept his theori and rais his name high in the list of it great
men they had still let him rot there that we had live to see his dust
in honor sepultur in the church of santa croce we owe to a societi of
literati and not to florenc or her ruler we saw dant tomb in that
church also but we were glad to know that his bodi was not in it that
the ungrat citi that had exil him and persecut him would give
much to have it there but need not hope to ever secur that high honor
to herself medici are good enough for florenc let her plant medici
and build grand monument over them to testifi how grate she was
wont to lick the hand that scourg her

magnanim florenc her jewelri mart are fill with artist in
mosaic florentin mosaic are the choicest in all the world florenc
love to have that said florenc is proud of it florenc would foster
this specialti of her she is grate to the artist that bring to her
this high credit and fill her coffer with foreign money and so she
encourag them with pension with pension think of the lavish
of it she know that peopl who piec togeth the beauti trifl
die earli becaus the labor is so confin and so exhaust to hand
and brain and so she has decre that all these peopl who reach the age
of sixti shall have a pension after that i have not heard that ani of
them have call for their dividend yet one man did fight along till
he was sixti and start after his pension but it appear that there
had been a mistak of a year in his famili record and so he gave it up
and die

these artist will take particl of stone or glass no larger than a
mustard seed and piec them togeth on a sleev button or a shirt stud
so smooth and with such nice adjust of the delic shade of color
the piec bear as to form a pigmi rose with stem thorn leav petal
complet and all as soft and as truth tint as though natur had
build it herself they will counterfeit a fli or a highton bug or
the ruin coliseum within the cramp circl of a breastpin and do it
so deft and so neat that ani man might think a master paint it

i saw a littl tabl in the great mosaic school in florencea littl
trifl of a centr tablewhos top was made of some sort of precious
polish stone and in the stone was inlaid the figur of a flute with
bellmouth and a mazi complic of key no paint in the world
could have been softer or richer no shade out of one tint into anoth
could have been more perfect no work of art of ani kind could have been
more faultless than this flute and yet to count the multitud of littl
fragment of stone of which they swore it was form would bankrupt ani
man arithmet i do not think one could have seen where two particl
join each other with eye of ordinari shrewd certain we could
detect no such blemish this tabletop cost the labor of one man for ten
long year so they said and it was for sale for thirtyf thousand
dollar

we went to the church of santa croce from time to time in florenc to
weep over the tomb of michael angelo raphael and machiavelli
i suppos they are buri there but it may be that they resid
elsewher and rent their tomb to other partiessuch be the fashion
in itali and between time we use to go and stand on the bridg and
admir the arno it is popular to admir the arno it is a great
histor creek with four feet in the channel and some scow float
around it would be a veri plausibl river if they would pump some water
into it they all call it a river and they honest think it is a
river do these dark and bloodi florentin they even help out the
delus by build bridg over it i do not see whi they are too good
to wade

how the fatigu and annoy of travel fill one with bitter prejudic
sometim i might enter florenc under happier auspic a month henc
and find it all beauti all attract but i do not care to think of
it now at all nor of it roomi shop fill to the ceil with snowi
marbl and alabast copi of all the celebr sculptur in europ
copi so enchant to the eye that i wonder how they can realli be
shape like the dingi petrifi nightmar they are the portrait of i
got lost in florenc at nine oclock one night and staid lost in that
labyrinth of narrow street and long row of vast build that look all
alik until toward three oclock in the morn it was a pleasant
night and at first there were a good mani peopl abroad and there were
cheer light about later i grew accustom to prowl about
mysteri drift and tunnel and astonish and interest myself with
come around corner expect to find the hotel stare me in the face
and not find it do ani thing of the kind later still i felt
tire i soon felt remark tire but there was no one abroad now
not even a policeman i walk till i was out of all patienc and veri
hot and thirsti at last somewher after one oclock i came
unexpect to one of the citi gate i knew then that i was veri far
from the hotel the soldier thought i want to leav the citi and
they sprang up and bar the way with their musket i said

hotel deurop 

it was all the italian i knew and i was not certain whether that was
italian or french the soldier look stupid at each other and at me
and shook their head and took me into custodi i said i want to go
home they did not understand me they took me into the guardhous and
search me but they found no sedit on me they found a small piec
of soap we carri soap with us now and i made them a present of it
see that they regard it as a curios i continu to say hotel
deurop and they continu to shake their head until at last a young
soldier nod in the corner rous up and said someth he said he
knew where the hotel was i suppos for the offic of the guard sent
him away with me we walk a hundr or a hundr and fifti mile it
appear to me and then he got lost he turn this way and that and
final gave it up and signifi that he was go to spend the remaind
of the morn tri to find the citi gate again at that moment it
struck me that there was someth familiar about the hous over the way
it was the hotel

it was a happi thing for me that there happen to be a soldier there
that knew even as much as he did for they say that the polici of the
govern is to chang the soldieri from one place to anoth constant
and from countri to citi so that they can not becom acquaint with the
peopl and grow lax in their duti and enter into plot and conspiraci
with friend my experi of florenc were chiefli unpleas i
will chang the subject

at pisa we climb up to the top of the strangest structur the world has
ani knowledg ofth lean tower as everi one know it is in the
neighborhood of one hundr and eighti feet highand i beg to observ
that one hundr and eighti feet reach to about the hight of four
ordinari threestori build pile one on top of the other and is a
veri consider altitud for a tower of uniform thick to aspir to
even when it stand uprightyet this one lean more than thirteen feet
out of the perpendicular it is seven hundr year old but neither
histori or tradit say whether it was built as it is purpos or
whether one of it side has settl there is no record that it ever
stood straight up it is built of marbl it is an airi and a beauti
structur and each of it eight stori is encircl by flute column
some of marbl and some of granit with corinthian capit that were
handsom when they were new it is a bell tower and in it top hang a
chime of ancient bell the wind staircas within is dark but one
alway know which side of the tower he is on becaus of his natur
gravit from one side to the other of the staircas with the rise or
dip of the tower some of the stone step are footworn onli on one end
other onli on the other end other onli in the middl to look down
into the tower from the top is like look down into a tilt well a
rope that hang from the centr of the top touch the wall befor it
reach the bottom stand on the summit one doe not feel altogeth
comfort when he look down from the high side but to crawl on your
breast to the verg on the lower side and tri to stretch your neck out
far enough to see the base of the tower make your flesh creep and
convinc you for a singl moment in spite of all your philosophi that
the build is fall you handl yourself veri care all the
time under the silli impress that if it is not fall your trifl
weight will start it unless you are particular not to bear down on it

the duomo close at hand is one of the finest cathedr in europ it
is eight hundr year old it grandeur has outliv the high
commerci prosper and the polit import that made it a
necess or rather a possibl surround by poverti decay and
ruin it convey to us a more tangibl impress of the former great
of pisa than book could give us

the baptisteri which is a few year older than the lean tower is a
state rotunda of huge dimens and was a cost structur in it
hang the lamp whose measur swing suggest to galileo the pendulum
it look an insignific thing to have confer upon the world of
scienc and mechan such a mighti extens of their dominion as it
has ponder in it suggest presenc i seem to see a crazi
univers of swing disk the toil children of this sedat parent
he appear to have an intellig express about him of know that
he was not a lamp at all that he was a pendulum a pendulum disguis
for prodigi and inscrut purpos of his own deep devis and not
a common pendulum either but the old origin patriarch pendulumth
abraham pendulum of the world

this baptisteri is endow with the most pleas echo of all the echo
we have read of the guid sound two sonor note about half an
octav apart the echo answer with the most enchant the most
melodi the richest blend of sweet sound that one can imagin it
was like a longdrawn chord of a church organ infinit soften by
distanc i may be extravag in this matter but if this be the case
my ear is to blamenot my pen i am describ a memoryand one that
will remain long with me

the peculiar devot spirit of the olden time which place a higher
confid in outward form of worship than in the watch guard of
the heart against sin thought and the hand against sin deed and
which believ in the protect virtu of inanim object made holi
by contact with holi thing is illustr in a strike manner in one
of the cemeteri of pisa the tomb are set in soil brought in ship
from the holi land age ago to be buri in such ground was regard by
the ancient pisan as be more potent for salvat than mani mass
purchas of the church and the vow of mani candl to the virgin

pisa is believ to be about three thousand year old it was one of the
twelv great citi of ancient etruria that commonwealth which has left
so mani monument in testimoni of it extraordinari advanc and so
littl histori of itself that is tangibl and comprehens a pisan
antiquarian gave me an ancient tearjug which he aver was full four
thousand year old it was found among the ruin of one of the oldest of
the etruscan citi he said it came from a tomb and was use by some
bereav famili in that remot age when even the pyramid of egypt were
young damascus a villag abraham a prattl infant and ancient troy
not yet dreampt of to receiv the tear wept for some lost idol of a
household it spoke to us in a languag of it own and with a patho
more tender than ani word might bring it mute eloqu swept down the
long roll of the centuri with it tale of a vacant chair a familiar
footstep miss from the threshold a pleasant voic gone from the
chorus a vanish form a tale which is alway so new to us so
startl so terribl so benumb to the sens and behold how
threadbar and old it is no shrewdlyword histori could have brought
the myth and shadow of that old dreami age befor us cloth with human
flesh and warm with human sympathi so vivid as did this poor littl
unsenti vessel of potteri

pisa was a republ in the middl age with a govern of her own
armi and navi of her own and a great commerc she was a warlik
power and inscrib upon her banner mani a brilliant fight with genoes
and turk it is said that the citi onc number a popul of four
hundr thousand but her sceptr has pass from her grasp now her
ship and her armi are gone her commerc is dead her battleflag
bear the mold and the dust of centuri her mart are desert she has
shrunken far within her crumbl wall and her great popul has
diminish to twenti thousand soul she has but one thing left to boast
of and that is not much viz she is the second citi of tuscani

we reach leghorn in time to see all we wish to see of it long befor
the citi gate were close for the even and then came on board the
ship

we felt as though we had been away from home an age we never entir
appreci befor what a veri pleasant den our stateroom is nor how
jolli it is to sit at dinner in one own seat in one own cabin and
hold familiar convers with friend in one own languag oh the
rare happi of comprehend everi singl word that is said and
know that everi word one say in return will be understood as well
we would talk ourselv to death now onli there are onli about ten
passeng out of the sixtyf to talk to the other are wander
we hard know where we shall not go ashor in leghorn we are
surfeit with italian citi for the present and much prefer to walk
the familiar quarterdeck and view this one from a distanc

the stupid magnat of this leghorn govern can not understand that so
larg a steamer as our could cross the broad atlant with no other
purpos than to indulg a parti of ladi and gentlemen in a pleasur
excurs it look too improb it is suspici they think
someth more import must be hidden behind it all they can not
understand it and they scorn the evid of the ship paper they
have decid at last that we are a battalion of incendiari bloodthirsti
garibaldian in disguis and in all serious they have set a
gunboat to watch the vessel night and day with order to close down on
ani revolutionari movement in a twinkl polic boat are on patrol
duti about us all the time and it is as much as a sailor liberti is
worth to show himself in a red shirt these policemen follow the
execut offic boat from shore to ship and from ship to shore and
watch his dark maneuvr with a vigil eye they will arrest him yet
unless he assum an express of counten that shall have less of
carnag insurrect and sedit in it a visit paid in a friend
way to general garibaldi yesterday by cordial invit by some of
our passeng has gone far to confirm the dread suspicion the
govern harbor toward us it is thought the friend visit was onli
the cloak of a bloodi conspiraci these peopl draw near and watch us
when we bath in the sea from the ship side do they think we are
commune with a reserv forc of rascal at the bottom

it is said that we shall probabl be quarantin at napl two or three
of us prefer not to run this risk therefor when we are rest we
propos to go in a french steamer to civita and from thenc to rome and
by rail to napl they do not quarantin the car no matter where they
got their passeng from




chapter xxv

there are a good mani thing about this itali which i do not understand
and more especi i can not understand how a bankrupt govern can
have such palati railroad depot and such marvel of turnpik whi
these latter are as hard as adam as straight as a line as smooth as
a floor and as white as snow when it is too dark to see ani other
object one can still see the white turnpik of franc and itali and
they are clean enough to eat from without a tablecloth and yet no
toll are charg

as for the railwaysw have none like them the car slide as smooth
along as if they were on runner the depot are vast palac of cut
marbl with state colonnad of the same royal stone travers them
from end to end and with ampl wall and ceil rich decor with
fresco the lofti gateway are grace with statu and the broad
floor are all laid in polish flag of marbl

these thing win me more than itali hundr galleri of priceless art
treasur becaus i can understand the one and am not compet to
appreci the other in the turnpik the railway the depot and
the new boulevard of uniform hous in florenc and other citi here i
see the genius of loui napoleon or rather i see the work of that
statesman imit but loui has taken care that in franc there shall
be a foundat for these improvementsmoney he has alway the
wherewith to back up his project they strengthen franc and never
weaken her her materi prosper is genuin but here the case is
differ this countri is bankrupt there is no real foundat for
these great work the prosper they would seem to indic is a
pretenc there is no money in the treasuri and so they enfeebl her
instead of strengthen itali has achiev the dearest wish of her
heart and becom an independ stateand in so do she has drawn an
eleph in the polit lotteri she has noth to feed it on
inexperienc in govern she plung into all manner of useless
expenditur and swamp her treasuri almost in a day she squander
million of franc on a navi which she did not need and the first time
she took her new toy into action she got it knock higher than
gilderoy kiteto use the languag of the pilgrim

but it is an illwind that blow nobodi good a year ago when itali saw
utter ruin stare her in the face and her greenback hard worth the
paper they were print on her parliament ventur upon a coup de main
that would have appal the stoutest of her statesmen under less
desper circumst they in a manner confisc the domain of
the church this in priestridden itali this in a land which has
grope in the midnight of priest superstit for sixteen hundr
year it was a rare good fortun for itali the stress of weather that
drove her to break from this prisonhous

they do not call it confisc the church properti that would sound
too harsh yet but it amount to that there are thousand of
church in itali each with untold million of treasur store away in
it closet and each with it battalion of priest to be support
and then there are the estat of the churchleagu on leagu of the
richest land and the noblest forest in all italyal yield immens
revenu to the church and none pay a cent in tax to the state
in some great district the church own all the propertyland
watercours wood mill and factori they buy they sell they
manufactur and sinc they pay no tax who can hope to compet with
them

well the govern has seiz all this in effect and will yet seiz it
in rigid and unpoet realiti no doubt someth must be done to
feed a starv treasuri and there is no other resourc in all itali
none but the rich of the church so the govern intend to take to
itself a great portion of the revenu aris from priest farm
factori etc and also intend to take possess of the church and
carri them on after it own fashion and upon it own respons
in a few instanc it will leav the establish of great pet church
undisturb but in all other onli a hand of priest will be retain
to preach and pray a few will be pension and the balanc turn
adrift

pray glanc at some of these church and their embellish and see
whether the govern is do a righteous thing or not in venic
today a citi of a hundr thousand inhabit there are twelv hundr
priest heaven onli know how mani there were befor the parliament
reduc their number there was the great jesuit church under the old
regim it requir sixti priest to engin itth govern doe it
with five now and the other are discharg from servic all about
that church wretched and poverti abound at it door a dozen hat
and bonnet were dof to us as mani head were humbl bow and as
mani hand extend appeal for penniesapp with foreign word
we could not understand but appeal mute with sad eye and sunken
cheek and rag raiment that no word were need to translat then
we pass within the great door and it seem that the rich of the
world were befor us huge column carv out of singl mass of
marbl and inlaid from top to bottom with a hundr intric figur
wrought in cost verd antiqu pulpit of the same rich materi
whose draperi hung down in mani a pictur fold the stoni fabric
counterfeit the delic work of the loom the grand altar brilliant
with polish face and balustrad of orient agat jasper verd
antiqu and other precious stone whose name even we seldom hear
and slab of priceless lapi lazuli lavish everi where as reckless as
if the church had own a quarri of it in the midst of all this
magnific the solid gold and silver furnitur of the altar seem
cheap and trivial even the floor and ceil cost a princ fortun

now where is the use of allow all those rich to lie idl while
half of that communiti hard know from day to day how they are go
to keep bodi and soul togeth and where is the wisdom in permit
hundr upon hundr of million of franc to be lock up in the
useless trumperi of church all over itali and the peopl ground to
death with taxat to uphold a perish govern

as far as i can see itali for fifteen hundr year has turn all her
energi all her financ and all her industri to the build up of a
vast array of wonder church edific and starv half her citizen
to accomplish it she is today one vast museum of magnific and
miseri all the church in an ordinari american citi put togeth could
hard buy the jewel fripperi in one of her hundr cathedr and
for everi beggar in america itali can show a hundredand rag and
vermin to match it is the wretchedest princeliest land on earth

look at the grand duomo of florencea vast pile that has been sap
the purs of her citizen for five hundr year and is not near
finish yet like all other men i fell down and worship it but
when the filthi beggar swarm around me the contrast was too strike
too suggest and i said o son of classic itali is the spirit of
enterpris of selfreli of nobl endeavor utter dead within ye
curs your indol worthless whi dont you rob your church 

three hundr happi comfort priest are employ in that cathedr

and now that my temper is up i may as well go on and abus everi bodi i
can think of they have a grand mausoleum in florenc which they built
to buri our lord and saviour and the medici famili in it sound
blasphem but it is true and here they act blasphemi the dead and
damn medici who cruelli tyrann over florenc and were her curs
for over two hundr year are salt away in a circl of cost vault
and in their midst the holi sepulchr was to have been set up the
expedit sent to jerusalem to seiz it got into troubl and could not
accomplish the burglari and so the centr of the mausoleum is vacant
now they say the entir mausoleum was intend for the holi sepulchr
and was onli turn into a famili buri place after the jerusalem
expedit failedbut you will excus me some of those medici would
have smuggl themselv in sure what they had not the effronteri to
do was not worth do whi they had their trivial forgotten exploit
on land and sea pictur out in grand fresco as did also the ancient
doge of venic with the saviour and the virgin throw bouquet to
them out of the cloud and the deiti himself applaud from his throne
in heaven and who paint these thing whi titian tintoretto paul
verones raphaelnon other than the world idol the old master 

andrea del sarto glorifi his princ in pictur that must save them
for ever from the oblivion they merit and they let him starv serv
him right raphael pictur such infern villain as catherin and
mari de medici seat in heaven and convers familiar with the
virgin mari and the angel to say noth of higher personag and
yet my friend abus me becaus i am a littl prejud against the old
mastersbecaus i fail sometim to see the beauti that is in their
product i can not help but see it now and then but i keep on
protest against the grovel spirit that could persuad those master
to prostitut their nobl talent to the adul of such monster as
the french venetian and florentin princ of two and three hundr
year ago all the same

i am told that the old master had to do these shame thing for bread
the princ and potent be the onli patron of art if a grand
gift man may drag his pride and his manhood in the dirt for bread
rather than starv with the nobil that is in him untaint the excus
is a valid one it would excus theft in washington and wellington
and unchast in women as well

but somehow i can not keep that medici mausoleum out of my memori it

church justic demand that if i know ani thing good about either i
ought to say it i have heard of mani thing that redound to the credit
of the priesthood but the most notabl matter that occur to me now is
the devot one of the mendic order show dure the preval of
the cholera last year i speak of the dominican friarsmen who wear a
coars heavi brown robe and a cowl in this hot climat and go
barefoot they live on alm altogeth i believ they must
unquestion love their religion to suffer so much for it when the
cholera was rage in napl when the peopl were die by hundr and
hundr everi day when everi concern for the public welfar was
swallow up in selfish privat interest and everi citizen made the
take care of himself his sole object these men band themselv
togeth and went about nurs the sick and buri the dead their
nobl effort cost mani of them their live they laid them down
cheer and well they might creed mathemat precis and
hairsplit niceti of doctrin are absolut necessari for the
salvat of some kind of soul but sure the chariti the puriti the
unselfish that are in the heart of men like these would save their
soul though they were bankrupt in the true religionwhich is our

one of these fat barefoot rascal came here to civita vecchia with us
in the littl french steamer there were onli half a dozen of us in the
cabin he belong in the steerag he was the life of the ship the
bloodymind son of the inquisit he and the leader of the marin
band of a french manofwar play on the piano and sang opera turn
about they sang duet togeth they rig impromptu theatric
costum and gave us extravag farc and pantomim we got along
firstrat with the friar and were excess convers albeit he
could not understand what we said and certain he never utter a word
that we could guess the mean of

this civita vecchia is the finest nest of dirt vermin and ignor we
have found yet except that african perdit they call tangier which is
just like it the peopl here live in alley two yard wide which have
a smell about them which is peculiar but not entertain it is well
the alley are not wider becaus they hold as much smell now as a person
can stand and of cours if they were wider they would hold more and
then the peopl would die these alley are pave with stone and
carpet with deceas cat and decay rag and decompos
vegetabletop and remnant of old boot all soak with dishwat
and the peopl sit around on stool and enjoy it they are indol as
a general thing and yet have few pastim they work two or three
hour at a time but not hard and then they knock off and catch fli
this doe not requir ani talent becaus they onli have to grabif
they do not get the one they are after they get anoth it is all the
same to them they have no partial whichev one they get is the
one they want

they have other kind of insect but it doe not make them arrog
they are veri quiet unpretend peopl they have more of these kind
of thing than other communiti but they do not boast

they are veri uncleanlythes peoplein face in person and dress
when they see ani bodi with a clean shirt on it arous their scorn
the women wash cloth half the day at the public tank in the street
but they are probabl somebodi els or may be they keep one set to
wear and anoth to wash becaus they never put on ani that have ever
been wash when they get done wash they sit in the alley and
nurs their cub they nurs one ashcat at a time and the other
scratch their back against the doorpost and are happi

all this countri belong to the papal state they do not appear to have
ani school here and onli one billiard tabl their educ is at a
veri low stage one portion of the men go into the militari anoth
into the priesthood and the rest into the shoemak busi

they keep up the passport system here but so they do in turkey this
show that the papal state are as far advanc as turkey this fact
will be alon suffici to silenc the tongu of malign
calumni i had to get my passport vise for rome in florenc and
then they would not let me come ashor here until a policeman had
examin it on the wharf and sent me a permit they did not even dare to
let me take my passport in my hand for twelv hour i look so
formid they judg it best to let me cool down they thought i
want to take the town like littl did they know me i wouldnt
have it they examin my baggag at the depot they took one of my
ablest joke and read it over care twice and then read it backward
but it was too deep for them they pass it around and everi bodi
specul on it awhil but it master them all

it was no common joke at length a veteran offic spell it over
deliber and shook his head three or four time and said that in his
opinion it was sediti that was the first time i felt alarm i
immedi said i would explain the document and they crowd around
and so i explain and explain and explain and they took note of
all i said but the more i explain the more they could not understand
it and when they desist at last i could not even understand it
myself they said they believ it was an incendiari document level
at the govern i declar solemn that it was not but they onli
shook their head and would not be satisfi then they consult a good
while and final they confisc it i was veri sorri for this
becaus i had work a long time on that joke and took a good deal of
pride in it and now i suppos i shall never see it ani more i suppos
it will be sent up and file away among the crimin archiv of rome
and will alway be regard as a mysteri infern machin which would
have blown up like a mine and scatter the good pope all around but for
a miracul providenti interfer and i suppos that all the time
i am in rome the polic will dog me about from place to place becaus
they think i am a danger charact

it is fear hot in civita vecchia the street are made veri narrow
and the hous built veri solid and heavi and high as a protect
against the heat this is the first italian town i have seen which doe
not appear to have a patron saint i suppos no saint but the one that
went up in the chariot of fire could stand the climat

there is noth here to see they have not even a cathedr with
eleven ton of solid silver archbishop in the back room and they do not
show you ani moldi build that are seven thousand year old nor ani
smokedri old firescreen which are chef doeuvr of reuben or
simpson or titian or ferguson or ani of those parti and they havent
ani bottl fragment of saint and not even a nail from the true cross
we are go to rome there is noth to see here

what is there in rome for me to see that other have not seen befor me
what is there for me to touch that other have not touch what is

befor it pass to other what can i discov noth noth

bewild world of unsuspect wonder i would discov ah if i
were onli a habit of the campagna five and twenti mile from rome
then i would travel

i would go to america and see and learn and return to the campagna and
stand befor my countrymen an illustri discover i would say

i saw there a countri which has no overshadow mother church and yet
the peopl surviv i saw a govern which never was protect by
foreign soldier at a cost greater than that requir to carri on the
govern itself i saw common men and common women who could read
i even saw small children of common countri peopl read from book
if i dare think you would believ it i would say they could write
also

in the citi i saw peopl drink a delici beverag made of chalk
and water but never onc saw goat driven through their broadway or
their pennsylvania avenu or their montgomeri street and milk at the
door of the hous i saw real glass window in the hous of even the
commonest peopl some of the hous are not of stone nor yet of
brick i solemn swear they are made of wood hous there will take
fire and burn sometimesactu burn entir down and not leav a
singl vestig behind i could state that for a truth upon my
deathb and as a proof that the circumst is not rare i aver
that they have a thing which they call a fireengin which vomit forth
great stream of water and is kept alway in readi by night and by
day to rush to hous that are burn you would think one engin
would be suffici but some great citi have a hundr they keep men
hire and pay them by the month to do noth but put out fire for a
certain sum of money other men will insur that your hous shall not
burn down and if it burn they will pay you for it there are hundr
and thousand of school and ani bodi may go and learn to be wise like
a priest in that singular countri if a rich man die a sinner he is
damn he can not buy salvat with money for mass there is realli
not much use in be rich there not much use as far as the other
world is concern but much veri much use as concern this becaus
there if a man be rich he is veri great honor and can becom a
legisl a governor a general a senat no matter how ignor an
ass he isjust as in our belov itali the nobl hold all the great
place even though sometim they are born nobl idiot there if a
man be rich they give him cost present they ask him to feast they
invit him to drink complic beverag but if he be poor and in
debt they requir him to do that which they term to settl  the
women put on a differ dress almost everi day the dress is usual
fine but absurd in shape the veri shape and fashion of it chang
twice in a hundr year and did i but covet to be call an
extravag falsifi i would say it chang even often hair doe
not grow upon the american women head it is made for them by cun
workmen in the shop and is curl and frizzl into scandal and
ungod form some person wear eye of glass which they see through
with facil perhap els they would not use them and in the mouth
of some are teeth made by the sacrilegi hand of man the dress of
the men is laughabl grotesqu they carri no musket in ordinari life
nor no longpoint pole they wear no wide greenlin cloak they wear
no peak black felt hat no leathern gaiter reach to the knee no
goatskin breech with the hair side out no hobnail shoe no
prodigi spur they wear a conic hat term a nailkag  a coat
of saddest black a shirt which show dirt so easili that it has to be
chang everi month and is veri troublesom thing call pantaloon
which are held up by shoulder strap and on their feet they wear boot
which are ridicul in pattern and can stand no wear yet dress in
this fantast garb these peopl laugh at my costum in that
countri book are so common that it is realli no curios to see one
newspap also they have a great machin which print such thing by
thousand everi hour

i saw common men theremen who were neither priest nor princeswho
yet absolut own the land they till it was not rent from the
church nor from the nobl i am readi to take my oath of this in
that countri you might fall from a third stori window three sever
time and not mash either a soldier or a priest the scarciti of such
peopl is astonish in the citi you will see a dozen civilian for
everi soldier and as mani for everi priest or preacher jew there
are treat just like human be instead of dog they can work at
ani busi they pleas they can sell brand new good if they want to
they can keep drugstor they can practic medicin among christian
they can even shake hand with christian if they choos they can
associ with them just the same as one human be doe with anoth
human be they dont have to stay shut up in one corner of the town
they can live in ani part of a town they like best it is said they even
have the privileg of buy land and hous and own them themselv
though i doubt that myself they never have had to run race nake
through the public street against jackass to pleas the peopl in
carniv time there they never have been driven by the soldier into a
church everi sunday for hundr of year to hear themselv and their
religion especi and particular curs at this veri day in that
curious countri a jew is allow to vote hold offic yea get up on a
rostrum in the public street and express his opinion of the govern if
the govern dont suit him ah it is wonder the common peopl
there know a great deal they even have the effronteri to complain if
they are not proper govern and to take hold and help conduct the
govern themselv if they had law like our which give one dollar
of everi three a crop produc to the govern for tax they would
have that law alter instead of pay thirtythre dollar in tax
out of everi one hundr they receiv they complain if they have to pay
seven they are curious peopl they do not know when they are well
off mendic priest do not prowl among them with basket beg for
the church and eat up their substanc one hard ever see a
minist of the gospel go around there in his bare feet with a
basket beg for subsist in that countri the preacher are not
like our mendic order of friarsthey have two or three suit of
cloth and they wash sometim in that land are mountain far higher
than the alban mountain the vast roman campagna a hundr mile long
and full forti broad is realli small compar to the unit state of
america the tiber that celebr river of our which stretch it
mighti cours almost two hundr mile and which a lad can scarc
throw a stone across at rome is not so long nor yet so wide as the
american mississippinor yet the ohio nor even the hudson in america
the peopl are absolut wiser and know much more than their
grandfath did they do not plow with a sharpen stick nor yet with
a threecorn block of wood that mere scratch the top of the
ground we do that becaus our father did three thousand year ago i
suppos but those peopl have no holi rever for their ancestor
they plow with a plow that is a sharp curv blade of iron and it cut
into the earth full five inch and this is not all they cut their
grain with a horrid machin that mow down whole field in a day if i
dare i would say that sometim they use a blasphem plow that work
by fire and vapor and tear up an acr of ground in a singl hourbut
buti see by your look that you do not believ the thing i am tell
you ala my charact is ruin and i am a brand speaker of
untruth 

of cours we have been to the monster church of st peter frequent
i knew it dimens i knew it was a prodigi structur i knew it
was just about the length of the capitol at washingtonsay seven hundr
and thirti feet i knew it was three hundr and sixtyfour feet wide
and consequ wider than the capitol i knew that the cross on the
top of the dome of the church was four hundr and thirtyeight feet
abov the ground and therefor about a hundr or may be a hundr and
twentyf feet higher than the dome of the capitol thus i had one
gaug i wish to come as near form a correct idea of how it was
go to look as possibl i had a curios to see how much i would
err i er consider st peter did not look near so larg as
the capitol and certain not a twentieth part as beauti from the
outsid

when we reach the door and stood fair within the church it was
imposs to comprehend that it was a veri larg build i had to
cipher a comprehens of it i had to ransack my memori for some more
simil st peter is bulki it height and size would repres two
of the washington capitol set one on top of the otherif the capitol
were wider or two block or two block and a half of ordinari build
set one on top of the other st peter was that larg but it could
and would not look so the troubl was that everi thing in it and about
it was on such a scale of uniform vast that there were no contrast
to judg bynon but the peopl and i had not notic them they were
insect the statu of children hold vase of holi water were
immens accord to the tabl of figur but so was everi thing els
around them the mosaic pictur in the dome were huge and were made of
thousand and thousand of cube of glass as larg as the end of my
littl finger but those pictur look smooth and gaudi of color and
in good proport to the dome evid they would not answer to
measur by away down toward the far end of the church i thought it was
realli clear at the far end but discov afterward that it was in the
centr under the dome stood the thing they call the baldacchinoa
great bronz pyramid framework like that which uphold a mosquito bar
it onli look like a consider magnifi bedsteadnoth more yet
i knew it was a good deal more than half as high as niagara fall it
was overshadow by a dome so mighti that it own height was snub
the four great squar pier or pillar that stand equidist from each
other in the church and support the roof i could not work up to their
real dimens by ani method of comparison i knew that the face of
each were about the width of a veri larg dwellinghous front fifti or
sixti feet and that they were twice as high as an ordinari threestori
dwell but still they look small i tri all the differ way i
could think of to compel myself to understand how larg st peter was
but with small success the mosaic portrait of an apostl who was
write with a pen six feet long seem onli an ordinari apostl

but the peopl attract my attent after a while to stand in the
door of st peter and look at men down toward it further extrem
two block away has a diminish effect on them surround by the
prodigi pictur and statu and lost in the vast space they look
veri much smaller than they would if they stood two block away in the
open air i averaged a man as he pass me and watch him as he
drift far down by the baldacchino and beyondwatch him dwindl to an
insignific schoolboy and then in the midst of the silent throng of
human pigmi glide about him i lost him the church had late been
decor on the occas of a great ceremoni in honor of st peter and
men were engag now in remov the flower and gilt paper from the
wall and pillar as no ladder could reach the great height the men
swung themselv down from balustrad and the capit of pilast by
rope to do this work the upper galleri which encircl the inner
sweep of the dome is two hundr and forti feet abov the floor of the
churchveri few steepl in america could reach up to it visitor
alway go up there to look down into the church becaus one get the best
idea of some of the height and distanc from that point while we
stood on the floor one of the workmen swung loos from that galleri at
the end of a long rope i had not suppos befor that a man could
look so much like a spider he was insignific in size and his rope
seem onli a thread see that he took up so littl space i could
believ the stori then that ten thousand troop went to st peter
onc to hear mass and their command offic came afterward and not
find them suppos they had not yet arriv but they were in the
church neverthelessthey were in one of the transept near fifti
thousand person assembl in st peter to hear the publish of the
dogma of the immacul concept it is estim that the floor of
the church afford stand room forfor a larg number of peopl i
have forgotten the exact figur but it is no matterit is near
enough

they have twelv small pillar in st peter which came from solomon
templ they have alsowhich was far more interest to mea piec
of the true cross and some nail and a part of the crown of thorn

of cours we ascend to the summit of the dome and of cours we also
went up into the gilt copper ball which is abov it there was room
there for a dozen person with a littl crowd and it was as close
and hot as an oven some of those peopl who are so fond of write
their name in promin place had been there befor usa million or
two i should think from the dome of st peter one can see everi
notabl object in rome from the castl of st angelo to the coliseum
he can discern the seven hill upon which rome is built he can see the
tiber and the local of the bridg which horatius kept in the brave
day of old when lar porsena attempt to cross it with his invad
host he can see the spot where the horatii and the curatii fought their
famous battl he can see the broad green campagna stretch away
toward the mountain with it scatter arch and broken aqueduct of
the olden time so picturesqu in their gray ruin and so daintili
festoon with vine he can see the alban mountain the appenin the
sabin hill and the blue mediterranean he can see a panorama that is
vari extens beauti to the eye and more illustri in histori
than ani other in europ about his feet is spread the remnant of a
citi that onc had a popul of four million soul and among it
mass edific stand the ruin of templ column and triumphal arch
that knew the caesar and the noonday of roman splendor and close by
them in unimpair strength is a drain of arch and heavi masonri that
belong to that older citi which stood here befor romulus and remus
were born or rome thought of the appian way is here yet and look
much as it did perhap when the triumphal process of the emperor
move over it in other day bring fetter princ from the confin
of the earth we can not see the long array of chariot and mailclad
men laden with the spoil of conquest but we can imagin the pageant
after a fashion we look out upon mani object of interest from the dome
of st peter and last of all almost at our feet our eye rest upon
the build which was onc the inquisit how time chang between
the older age and the new some seventeen or eighteen centuri ago
the ignor men of rome were wont to put christian in the arena of the
coliseum yonder and turn the wild beast in upon them for a show it
was for a lesson as well it was to teach the peopl to abhor and fear
the new doctrin the follow of christ were teach the beast tore
the victim limb from limb and made poor mangl corps of them in the
twinkl of an eye but when the christian came into power when the
holi mother church becam mistress of the barbarian she taught them the
error of their way by no such mean no she put them in this pleasant
inquisit and point to the bless redeem who was so gentl and so
merci toward all men and they urg the barbarian to love him and
they did all they could to persuad them to love and honor himfirst by
twist their thumb out of joint with a screw then by nip their
flesh with pincersredhot one becaus they are the most comfort
in cold weather then by skin them aliv a littl and final by
roast them in public they alway convinc those barbarian the
true religion proper administ as the good mother church use to
administ it is veri veri sooth it is wonder persuas
also there is a great differ between feed parti to wild beast
and stir up their finer feel in an inquisit one is the
system of degrad barbarian the other of enlighten civil
peopl it is a great piti the play inquisit is no more

i prefer not to describ st peter it has been done befor the
ash of peter the discipl of the saviour repos in a crypt under the
baldacchino we stood rever in that place so did we also in the
mamertin prison where he was confin where he convert the soldier
and where tradit say he caus a spring of water to flow in order
that he might baptiz them but when they show us the print of peter
face in the hard stone of the prison wall and said he made that by
fall up against it we doubt and when also the monk at the
church of san sebastian show us a pavingston with two great
footprint in it and said that peter feet made those we lack
confid again such thing do not impress one the monk said that
angel came and liber peter from prison by night and he start away
from rome by the appian way the saviour met him and told him to go
back which he did peter left those footprint in the stone upon which
he stood at the time it was not state how it was ever discov whose
footprint they were see the interview occur secret and at
night the print of the face in the prison was that of a man of common
size the footprint were those of a man ten or twelv feet high the
discrep confirm our unbelief

we necessarili visit the forum where caesar was assassin and also
the tarpeian rock we saw the die gladiat at the capitol and i
think that even we appreci that wonder of art as much perhap as
we did that fear stori wrought in marbl in the vaticanth laocoon
and then the coliseum

everi bodi know the pictur of the coliseum everi bodi recogn at
onc that loop and windowed bandbox with a side bitten out be
rather isol it show to better advantag than ani other of the
monument of ancient rome even the beauti pantheon whose pagan
altar uphold the cross now and whose venus trick out in consecr
gimcrack doe reluct duti as a virgin mari today is built about
with shabbi hous and it stateli sad mar but the monarch of
all european ruin the coliseum maintain that reserv and that royal
seclus which is proper to majesti weed and flower spring from it
massi arch and it circl seat and vine hang their fring from
it lofti wall an impress silenc brood over the monstrous
structur where such multitud of men and women were wont to assembl in
other day the butterfli have taken the place of the queen of
fashion and beauti of eighteen centuri ago and the lizard sun
themselv in the sacr seat of the emperor more vivid than all the
written histori the coliseum tell the stori of rome grandeur and
rome decay it is the worthiest type of both that exist move
about the rome of today we might find it hard to believ in her old
magnific and her million of popul but with this stubborn
evid befor us that she was oblig to have a theatr with sit
room for eighti thousand person and stand room for twenti thousand
more to accommod such of her citizen as requir amus we find
belief less difficult the coliseum is over one thousand six hundr
feet long seven hundr and fifti wide and one hundr and sixtyf
high it shape is oval

in america we make convict use at the same time that we punish them
for their crime we farm them out and compel them to earn money for the
state by make barrel and build road thus we combin busi
with retribut and all thing are love but in ancient rome they
combin religi duti with pleasur sinc it was necessari that the
new sect call christian should be extermin the peopl judg it
wise to make this work profit to the state at the same time and
entertain to the public in addit to the gladiatori combat and
other show they sometim threw member of the hate sect into the
arena of the coliseum and turn wild beast in upon them it is
estim that seventi thousand christian suffer martyrdom in this
place this has made the coliseum holi ground in the eye of the
follow of the saviour and well it might for if the chain that bound
a saint and the footprint a saint has left upon a stone he chanc to
stand upon be holi sure the spot where a man gave up his life for his
faith is holi

seventeen or eighteen centuri ago this coliseum was the theatr of
rome and rome was mistress of the world splendid pageant were
exhibit here in presenc of the emperor the great minist of state
the nobl and vast audienc of citizen of smaller consequ
gladiat fought with gladiat and at time with warrior prison
from mani a distant land it was the theatr of romeof the worldand
the man of fashion who could not let fall in a casual and unintent
manner someth about mi privat box at the coliseum could not move in
the first circl when the clothingstor merchant wish to consum
the corner groceri man with envi he bought secur seat in the front
row and let the thing be known when the irresist dri good clerk
wish to blight and destroy accord to his nativ instinct he got
himself up regardless of expens and took some other fellow young ladi
to the coliseum and then accent the affront by cram her with ice

the open season coliseum notwithstand the inclem of
the weather quit a respect number of the rank and fashion of
the citi assembl last night to wit the debut upon metropolitan
board of the young tragedian who has of late been win such
golden opinion in the amphitheatr of the provinc some sixti
thousand person were present and but for the fact that the street
were almost impass it is fair to presum that the hous would
have been full his august majesti the emperor aurelius occupi
the imperi box and was the cynosur of all eye mani
illustri nobl and general of the empir grace the occas
with their presenc and not the least among them was the young
patrician lieuten whose laurel won in the rank of the
thunder legion  are still so green upon his brow the cheer
which greet his entranc was heard beyond the tiber

the late repair and decor add both to the comeli and the
comfort of the coliseum the new cushion are a great improv
upon the hard marbl seat we have been so long accustom to the
present manag deserv well of the public they have restor
to the coliseum the gild the rich upholsteri and the uniform
magnific which old coliseum frequent tell us rome was so
proud of fifti year ago

the open scene last nightth broadsword combat between two
young amateur and a famous parthian gladiat who was sent here a
prisonerwa veri fine the elder of the two young gentlemen
handl his weapon with a grace that mark the possess of
extraordinari talent his feint of thrust follow instant by
a happili deliv blow which unhelmet the parthian was receiv
with hearti applaus he was not thorough up in the backhand
stroke but it was veri gratifi to his numer friend to know
that in time practic would have overcom this defect howev
he was kill his sister who were present express
consider regret his mother left the coliseum the other youth
maintain the contest with such spirit as to call forth
enthusiast burst of applaus when at last he fell a corps his
age mother ran scream with hair dishevel and tear stream
from her eye and swoon away just as her hand were clutch at
the rail of the arena she was prompt remov by the polic
under the circumst the woman conduct was pardon perhap
but we suggest that such exhibit interfer with the decorum
which should be preserv dure the perform and are high
improp in the presenc of the emperor the parthian prison
fought brave and well and well he might for he was fight for
both life and liberti his wife and children were there to nerv
his arm with their love and to remind him of the old home he should
see again if he conquer when his second assail fell the
woman clasp her children to her breast and wept for joy but it
was onli a transient happi the captiv stagger toward her
and she saw that the liberti he had earn was earn too late he
was wound unto death thus the first act close in a manner which
was entir satisfactori the manag was call befor the
curtain and return his thank for the honor done him in a speech
which was replet with wit and humor and close by hope that his
humbl effort to afford cheer and instruct entertain
would continu to meet with the approb of the roman public

the star now appear and was receiv with vocifer applaus
and the simultan wave of sixti thousand handkerchief marcus
marcellus valerian stage namehi real name is smith is a
splendid specimen of physic develop and an artist of rare
merit his manag of the battleax is wonder his gayeti
and his play are irresist in his comic part and yet
they are inferior to his sublim concept in the grave realm of
tragedi when his ax was describ fieri circl about the head
of the bewild barbarian in exact time with his spring bodi
and his pranc leg the audienc gave way to uncontrol
burst of laughter but when the back of his weapon broke the skull
of one and almost in the same instant it edg clove the other
bodi in twain the howl of enthusiast applaus that shook the
build was the acknowledg of a critic assemblag that he
was a master of the noblest depart of his profess if he has
a fault and we are sorri to even intim that he has it is that
of glanc at the audienc in the midst of the most excit
moment of the perform as if seek admir the paus
in a fight to bow when bouquet are thrown to him is also in bad
tast in the great lefthand combat he appear to be look at
the audienc half the time instead of carv his adversari and
when he had slain all the sophomor and was dalli with the
freshman he stoop and snatch a bouquet as it fell and offer
it to his adversari at a time when a blow was descend which
promis favor to be his deathwarr such leviti is proper
enough in the provinc we make no doubt but it ill suit the
digniti of the metropoli we trust our young friend will take
these remark in good part for we mean them sole for his benefit
all who know us are awar that although we are at time just
sever upon tiger and martyr we never intent offend
gladiat

the infant prodigi perform wonder he overcam his four tiger
whelp with eas and with no other hurt than the loss of a portion
of his scalp the general slaughter was render with a
faith to detail which reflect the highest credit upon the
late particip in it

upon the whole last night perform shed honor not onli upon
the manag but upon the citi that encourag and sustain such
wholesom and instruct entertain we would simpli suggest
that the practic of vulgar young boy in the galleri of shi
peanut and paper pellet at the tiger and say hiyi  and
manifest approb or dissatisfact by such observ as
bulli for the lion  go it gladdi  boot  speech  take
a walk round the block  and so on are extrem reprehens
when the emperor is present and ought to be stop by the polic

to drag out the bodi the young ruffian in the galleri shout
supe supe  and also oh what a coat  and whi dont you pad

chapter xxvii

so far good if ani man has a right to feel proud of himself and
satisfi sure it is i for i have written about the coliseum and
the gladiat the martyr and the lion and yet have never onc use
the phrase butcher to make a roman holiday  i am the onli free white
man of matur age who has accomplish this sinc byron origin the
express

butcher to make a roman holiday sound well for the first seventeen or
eighteen hundr thousand time one see it in print but after that it
begin to grow tiresom i find it in all the book concern romeand
here latter it remind me of judg oliv oliv was a young lawyer
fresh from the school who had gone out to the desert of nevada to
begin life he found that countri and our way of life there in those
earli day differ from life in new england or pari but he put on a
woollen shirt and strap a navi revolv to his person took to the
bacon and bean of the countri and determin to do in nevada as nevada
did oliv accept the situat so complet that although he must
have sorrow over mani of his trial he never complainedthat is he
never complain but onc he two other and myself start to the
new silver mine in the humboldt mountainsh to be probat judg of
humboldt counti and we to mine the distanc was two hundr mile it
was dead of winter we bought a twohors wagon and put eighteen hundr
pound of bacon flour bean blastingpowd pick and shovel in it
we bought two sorrylook mexican plug  with the hair turn the
wrong way and more corner on their bodi than there are on the mosqu
of omar we hitch up and start it was a dread trip but oliv
did not complain the hors drag the wagon two mile from town and
then gave out then we three push the wagon seven mile and oliv
move ahead and pull the hors after him by the bit we complain
but oliv did not the ground was frozen and it froze our back while
we slept the wind swept across our face and froze our nose oliv
did not complain five day of push the wagon by day and freez by
night brought us to the bad part of the journeyth forti mile desert
or the great american desert if you pleas still this
mildestmann man that ever was had not complain we start across
at eight in the morn push through sand that had no bottom toil
all day long by the wreck of a thousand wagon the skeleton of ten
thousand oxen by wagontir enough to hoop the washington monument to
the top and oxchain enough to girdl long island by human grave
with our throat parch alway with thirst lip bleed from the
alkali dust hungri perspir and veri veri wearyso weari that when
we drop in the sand everi fifti yard to rest the hors we could
hard keep from go to sleepno complaint from oliv none the next
morn at three oclock when we got across tire to death

awaken two or three night afterward at midnight in a narrow canon by
the snow fall on our face and appal at the immin danger of
be snow in  we har up and push on till eight in the
morn pass the divide and knew we were save no complaint
fifteen day of hardship and fatigu brought us to the end of the two
hundr mile and the judg had not complain we wonder if ani
thing could exasper him we built a humboldt hous it is done in
this way you dig a squar in the steep base of the mountain and set up
two upright and top them with two joist then you stretch a great
sheet of cotton domestic from the point where the joist join the
hillsid down over the joist to the ground this make the roof and the
front of the mansion the side and back are the dirt wall your dig
has left a chimney is easili made by turn up one corner of the roof
oliv was sit alon in this dismal den one night by a sagebrush
fire write poetri he was veri fond of dig poetri out of himself
or blast it out when it came hard he heard an anim footstep
close to the roof a stone or two and some dirt came through and fell by
him he grew uneasi and said hi clear out from there cant you 
from time to time but by and by he fell asleep where he sat and pretti
soon a mule fell down the chimney the fire flew in everi direct and
oliv went over backward about ten night after that he recov
confid enough to go to write poetri again again he doze off to
sleep and again a mule fell down the chimney this time about half of
that side of the hous came in with the mule struggl to get up the
mule kick the candl out and smash most of the kitchen furnitur and
rais consider dust these violent awaken must have been
annoy to oliv but he never complain he move to a mansion on
the opposit side of the canon becaus he had notic the mule did not
go there one night about eight oclock he was endeavor to finish his
poem when a stone roll inthen a hoof appear below the canvasthen
part of a cowth after part he lean back in dread and shout
hooy hooy get out of this  and the cow struggl manfullylost
ground steadilydirt and dust stream down and befor oliv could get
well away the entir cow crash through on to the tabl and made a
shapeless wreck of everi thing

then for the first time in his life i think oliv complain he
said

this thing is grow monoton 

then he resign his judgeship and left humboldt counti butcher to
make a roman holyday has grown monoton to me

in this connect i wish to say one word about michael angelo
buonarotti i use to worship the mighti genius of michael angelothat
man who was great in poetri paint sculptur architecturegreat in
everi thing he undertook but i do not want michael angelo for

we have been in the catacomb it was like go down into a veri deep
cellar onli it was a cellar which had no end to it the narrow passag
are rough hewn in the rock and on each hand as you pass along the
hollow shelv are carv out from three to fourteen deep each held a
corps onc there are name and christian symbol and prayer or
sentenc express of christian hope carv upon near everi
sarcophagus the date belong away back in the dawn of the christian
era of cours here in these hole in the ground the first christian
sometim burrow to escap persecut they crawl out at night to
get food but remain under cover in the day time the priest told us
that st sebastian live under ground for some time while he was be

thereabout it is veri suggest of the unhealthi of underground
graveyard as place of resid one pope afterward spent his entir
pontif in the catacombseight year anoth was discov in
them and murder in the episcop chair there was no satisfact in
be a pope in those day there were too mani annoy there are
one hundr and sixti catacomb under rome each with it maze of narrow
passag cross and recross each other and each passag wall to
the top with scoop grave it entir length a care estim make
the length of the passag of all the catacomb combin foot up nine
hundr mile and their grave number seven million we did not go
through all the passag of all the catacomb we were veri anxious to
do it and made the necessari arrang but our too limit time
oblig us to give up the idea so we onli grope through the dismal
labyrinth of st callixtus under the church of st sebastian in the
various catacomb are small chapel rude hewn in the stone and here
the earli christian often held their religi servic by dim ghost
light think of mass and a sermon away down in those tangl cavern
under ground

in the catacomb were buri st cecilia st agn and sever other of
the most celebr of the saint in the catacomb of st callixtus st
bridget use to remain long hour in holi contempl and st charl
borromeo was wont to spend whole night in prayer there it was also the
scene of a veri marvel thing

here the heart of st philip neri was so inflam with divin love
as to burst his rib 

i find that grave statement in a book publish in new york in  and
written by rev william h neligan ll d m a triniti colleg
dublin member of the archaeolog societi of great britain 
therefor i believ it otherwis i could not under other
circumst i should have felt a curios to know what philip had for

this author put my credul on it mettl everi now and then he tell
of one st joseph calasanctius whose hous in rome he visit he visit
onli the houseth priest has been dead two hundr year he say the
virgin mari appear to this saint then he continu

his tongu and his heart which were found after near a centuri
to be whole when the bodi was disint befor his canon
are still preserv in a glass case and after two centuri the
heart is still whole when the french troop came to rome and when
pius vii was carri away prison blood drop from it 

to read that in a book written by a monk far back in the middl age

chapter xxviii

from the sanguinari sport of the holi inquisit the slaughter of the
coliseum and the dismal tomb of the catacomb i natur pass to the
picturesqu horror of the capuchin convent we stop a moment in a
small chapel in the church to admir a pictur of st michael vanquish
satana pictur which is so beauti that i can not but think it
belong to the revil renaiss  notwithstand i believ they told
us one of the ancient old master paint itand then we descend into
the vast vault underneath

here was a spectacl for sensit nerv evid the old master had
been at work in this place there were six divis in the apart
and each divis was ornament with a style of decor peculiar to
itselfand these decor were in everi instanc form of human
bone there were shape arch built wholli of thigh bone there
were startl pyramid built wholli of grin skull there were
quaint architectur structur of various kind built of shin bone and
the bone of the arm on the wall were elabor fresco whose curv
vine were made of knot human vertebra whose delic tendril were
made of sinew and tendon whose flower were form of kneecap and
toenail everi last portion of the human frame was repres in
these intric design they were by michael angelo i think and there
was a care finish about the work and an attent to detail that
betray the artist love of his labor as well as his school abil
i ask the goodnatur monk who accompani us who did this and he
said we did itmean himself and his brethren up stair i could
see that the old friar took a high pride in his curious show we made
him talkat by exhibit an interest we never betray to guid

who were these peopl 

weup stairsmonk of the capuchin ordermi brethren 

how mani depart monk were requir to upholst these six parlor 

these are the bone of four thousand 

it took a long time to get enough 

mani mani centuri 

their differ part are well separatedskul in one room leg in
anoth rib in anotherther would be stir time here for a while
if the last trump should blow some of the brethren might get hold of
the wrong leg in the confus and the wrong skull and find themselv
limp and look through eye that were wider apart or closer
togeth than they were use to you can not tell ani of these parti
apart i suppos 

oh yes i know mani of them 

he put his finger on a skull this was brother anselmodead three
hundr yearsa good man 

he touch anoth this was brother alexanderdead two hundr and
eighti year this was brother carlodead about as long 

then he took a skull and held it in his hand and look reflect
upon it after the manner of the gravedigg when he discours of
yorick

this  he said was brother thoma he was a young princ the scion
of a proud hous that trace it lineag back to the grand old day of
rome well nigh two thousand year ago he love beneath his estat his
famili persecut him persecut the girl as well they drove her from
rome he follow he sought her far and wide he found no trace of her
he came back and offer his broken heart at our altar and his weari life
to the servic of god but look you short his father die and
likewis his mother the girl return rejoic she sought everi
where for him whose eye had use to look tender into her out of this
poor skull but she could not find him at last in this coars garb we
wear she recogn him in the street he knew her it was too late
he fell where he stood they took him up and brought him here he never
spoke afterward within the week he die you can see the color of his
hairfad somewhatbi this thin shred that cling still to the
templ this take up a thigh bone  was his the vein of this
leaf in the decor over your head were his fingerjoint a hundr
and fifti year ago 

this businesslik way of illustr a touch stori of the heart by
lay the sever fragment of the lover befor us and name them was
as grotesqu a perform and as ghast as ani i ever wit i
hard knew whether to smile or shudder there are nerv and muscl in
our frame whose function and whose method of work it seem a sort
of sacrileg to describ by cold physiolog name and surgic
technic and the monk talk suggest to me someth of this
kind fanci a surgeon with his nipper lift tendon muscl and
such thing into view out of the complex machineri of a corps and
observ now this littl nerv quiversth vibrat is impart to
this musclefrom here it is pass to this fibrous substanc here it
ingredi are separ by the chemic action of the bloodon part
goe to the heart and thrill it with what is popular term emot
anoth part follow this nerv to the brain and communic
intellig of a startl characterth third part glide along this
passag and touch the spring connect with the fluid receptacl that
lie in the rear of the eye thus by this simpl and beauti process
the parti is inform that his mother is dead and he weep  horribl

i ask the monk if all the brethren up stair expect to be put in this
place when they die he answer quiet

we must all lie here at last 

see what one can accustom himself to the reflect that he must some
day be taken apart like an engin or a clock or like a hous whose owner
is gone and work up into arch and pyramid and hideous fresco did
not distress this monk in the least i thought he even look as if he
were think with complac vaniti that his own skull would look well
on top of the heap and his own rib add a charm to the fresco which
possibl they lack at present

here and there in ornament alcov stretch upon bed of bone lay
dead and driedup monk with lank frame dress in the black robe one
see ordinarili upon priest we examin one close the skinni hand
were clasp upon the breast two lustreless tuft of hair stuck to the
skull the skin was brown and sunken it stretch tight over the cheek
bone and made them stand out sharpli the crisp dead eye were deep in
the socket the nostril were pain promin the end of the nose
be gone the lip had shrivel away from the yellow teeth and
brought down to us through the circl year and petrifi there was a
weird laugh a full centuri old

it was the jolliest laugh but yet the most dread that one can
imagin sure i thought it must have been a most extraordinari joke
this veteran produc with his latest breath that he has not got done
laugh at it yet at this moment i saw that the old instinct was
strong upon the boy and i said we had better hurri to st peter
they were tri to keep from ask isi he dead 

it make me dizzi to think of the vaticanof it wilder of statu
paint and curios of everi descript and everi age the old
masters especi in sculptur fair swarm there i can not write
about the vatican i think i shall never rememb ani thing i saw there
distinct but the mummi and the transfigur by raphael and some
other thing it is not necessari to mention now i shall rememb the
transfigur part becaus it was place in a room almost by itself
part becaus it is acknowledg by all to be the first oil paint in
the world and part becaus it was wonder beauti the color
are fresh and rich the express  i am told is fine the feeling
is live the tone is good the depth is profound and the width is
about four and a half feet i should judg it is a pictur that realli
hold one attent it beauti is fascin it is fine enough to
be a renaiss a remark i made a while ago suggest a thoughtand a
hope is it not possibl that the reason i find such charm in this
pictur is becaus it is out of the crazi chao of the galleri if
some of the other were set apart might not they be beauti if this
were set in the midst of the tempest of pictur one find in the vast
galleri of the roman palac would i think it so handsom if up to
this time i had seen onli one old master in each palac instead of
acr and acr of wall and ceil fair paper with them might i
not have a more civil opinion of the old master than i have now i
think so when i was a schoolboy and was to have a new knife i could
not make up my mind as to which was the prettiest in the showcas and i
did not think ani of them were particular pretti and so i chose with a
heavi heart but when i look at my purchas at home where no
glitter blade came into competit with it i was astonish to see
how handsom it was to this day my new hat look better out of the shop
than they did in it with other new hat it begin to dawn upon me now
that possibl what i have been take for uniform ugli in the
galleri may be uniform beauti after all i honest hope it is to
other but certain it is not to me perhap the reason i use to
enjoy go to the academi of fine art in new york was becaus there
were but a few hundr paint in it and it did not surfeit me to go
through the list i suppos the academi was bacon and bean in the
fortymil desert and a european galleri is a state dinner of thirteen
cours one leav no sign after him of the one dish but the thirteen
frighten away his appetit and give him no satisfact

there is one thing i am certain of though with all the michael
angelo the raphael the guido and the other old master the sublim
histori of rome remain unpaint they paint virgin enough and
pope enough and saint scarecrow enough to peopl paradis almost
and these thing are all they did paint nero fiddl oer burn
rome  the assassin of caesar the stir spectacl of a hundr
thousand peopl bend forward with rapt interest in the coliseum to
see two skill gladiat hack away each other live a tiger
spring upon a kneel martyrthes and a thousand other matter
which we read of with a live interest must be sought for onli in
booksnot among the rubbish left by the old masterswho are no more i
have the satisfact of inform the public

they did paint and they did carv in marbl one histor scene and
one onli of ani great histor consequ and what was it and whi
did they choos it particular it was the rape of the sabin and
they chose it for the leg and bust

i like to look at statu howev and i like to look at pictur also
even of monk look up in sacr ecstaci and monk look down in
medit and monk skirmish for someth to eatand therefor i
drop ill natur to thank the papal govern for so jealous guard
and so industri gather up these thing and for permit me a
stranger and not an entir friend one to roam at will and unmolest
among them charg me noth and onli requir that i shall behav
myself simpli as well as i ought to behav in ani other man hous i
thank the holi father right heartili and i wish him long life and plenti
of happi

the pope have long been the patron and preserv of art just as our
new practic republ is the encourag and uphold of mechan in
their vatican is store up all that is curious and beauti in art in
our patent offic is hoard all that is curious or use in mechan
when a man invent a new style of horsecollar or discov a new and
superior method of telegraph our govern issu a patent to him
that is worth a fortun when a man dig up an ancient statu in the
campagna the pope give him a fortun in gold coin we can make
someth of a guess at a man charact by the style of nose he carri
on his face the vatican and the patent offic are government nose
and they bear a deal of charact about them

the guid show us a coloss statu of jupit in the vatican which
he said look so damag and rustyso like the god of the vagabond
becaus it had but recent been dug up in the campagna he ask how
much we suppos this jupit was worth i repli with intellig
prompt that he was probabl worth about four dollarsmay be four
and a half a hundr thousand dollar  ferguson said ferguson
said further that the pope permit no ancient work of this kind to
leav his dominion he appoint a commiss to examin discoveri
like this and report upon the valu then the pope pay the discover
onehalf of that assess valu and take the statu he said this
jupit was dug from a field which had just been bought for thirtysix
thousand dollar so the first crop was a good one for the new farmer
i do not know whether ferguson alway tell the truth or not but i
suppos he doe i know that an exorbit export duti is exact upon
all pictur paint by the old master in order to discourag the sale
of those in the privat collect i am satisfi also that genuin
old master hard exist at all in america becaus the cheapest and
most insignific of them are valu at the price of a fine farm i
propos to buy a small trifl of a raphael myself but the price of it
was eighti thousand dollar the export duti would have made it
consider over a hundr and so i studi on it awhil and conclud
not to take it

i wish here to mention an inscript i have seen befor i forget it

glori to god in the highest peac on earth to men of good will  it is
not good scriptur but it is sound cathol and human natur

this is in letter of gold around the apsi of a mosaic group at the side
of the scala santa church of st john lateran the mother and mistress
of all the cathol church of the world the group repres the
saviour st peter pope leo st silvest constantin and charlemagn
peter is give the pallium to the pope and a standard to charlemagn
the saviour is give the key to st silvest and a standard to
constantin no prayer is offer to the saviour who seem to be of
littl import ani where in rome but an inscript below say
bless peter give life to pope leo and victori to king charl  it
doe not say interced for us through the saviour with the father
for this boon  but bless peter give it us 

in all seriousnesswithout mean to be frivolouswithout mean to
be irrever and more than all without mean to be blasphem i
state as my simpl deduct from the thing i have seen and the thing i
have heard that the holi personag rank thus in rome

firstth mother of godotherwis the virgin mari

secondth deiti

thirdpet

fourthsom twelv or fifteen canon pope and martyr

fifthjesus christ the saviour but alway as an infant in arm

i may be wrong in thismi judgment err often just as is the case with
other mensbut it is my judgment be it good or bad

just here i will mention someth that seem curious to me there are
no christ churches in rome and no church of the holi ghost  that
i can discov there are some four hundr church but about a fourth
of them seem to be name for the madonna and st peter there are so
mani name for mari that they have to be distinguish by all sort of
affix if i understand the matter right then we have church of
st loui st augustin st agn st calixtus st lorenzo in lucina
st lorenzo in damaso st cecilia st athanasius st philip neri st
catherin st dominico and a multitud of lesser saint whose name are
not familiar in the worldand away down clear out of the list of the
church come a coupl of hospit one of them is name for the
saviour and the other for the holi ghost

day after day and night after night we have wander among the crumbl
wonder of rome day after day and night after night we have fed upon the
dust and decay of fiveandtwenti centurieshav brood over them by
day and dreampt of them by night till sometim we seem molder away
ourselv and grow defac and cornerless and liabl at ani moment
to fall a prey to some antiquari and be patch in the leg and
restored with an unseem nose and label wrong and date wrong and
set up in the vatican for poet to drivel about and vandal to scribbl
their name on forev and forevermor

but the surest way to stop write about rome is to stop i wish to
write a real guidebook chapter on this fascin citi but i could
not do it becaus i have felt all the time like a boy in a candyshop
there was everi thing to choos from and yet no choic i have drift
along hopeless for a hundr page of manuscript without know where
to commenc i will not commenc at all our passport have been
examin we will go to napl

ascent of vesuvius

i shall rememb our trip to vesuvius for mani a daypart becaus of
it sightse experi but chiefli on account of the fatigu of
the journey two or three of us had been rest ourselv among the
tranquil and beauti sceneri of the island of ischia eighteen mile
out in the harbor for two day we call it rest  but i do not
rememb now what the rest consist of for when we got back to
napl we had not slept for fortyeight hour we were just about to go
to bed earli in the even and catch up on some of the sleep we had
lost when we heard of this vesuvius expedit there was to be eight
of us in the parti and we were to leav napl at midnight we laid in
some provis for the trip engag carriag to take us to
annunci and then move about the citi to keep awak till twelv
we got away punctual and in the cours of an hour and a half arriv
at the town of annunci annunci is the veri last place under
the sun in other town in itali the peopl lie around quiet and wait
for you to ask them a question or do some overt act that can be charg
forbut in annunci they have lost even that fragment of delicaci
they seiz a ladi shawl from a chair and hand it to her and charg a
penni they open a carriag door and charg for itshut it when you get
out and charg for it they help you to take off a dustertwo cent
brush your cloth and make them wors than they were beforetwo cent
smile upon youtwo cent bow with a lickspittl smirk hat in hand
two cent they volunt all inform such as that the mule will
arriv presentlytwo centswarm day sirtwo centstak you four
hour to make the ascenttwo cent and so they go they crowd you
infest youswarm about you and sweat and smell offens and look
sneak and mean and obsequi there is no offic too degrad for
them to perform for money i have had no opportun to find out ani
thing about the upper class by my own observ but from what i hear
said about them i judg that what they lack in one or two of the bad
trait the canaill have they make up in one or two other that are
wors how the peopl beg mani of them veri well dress too

i said i knew noth against the upper class by person observ
i must recal it i had forgotten what i saw their bravest and their
fairest do last night the lowest multitud that could be scrape up out
of the purlieus of christendom would blush to do i think they
assembl by hundr and even thousand in the great theatr of san
carlo to dowhat whi simpli to make fun of an old womanto derid
to hiss to jeer at an actress they onc worship but whose beauti is
fade now and whose voic has lost it former rich everi bodi spoke
of the rare sport there was to be they said the theatr would be
cram becaus frezzolini was go to sing it was said she could not
sing well now but then the peopl like to see her anyhow and so we
went and everi time the woman sang they hiss and laughedth whole
magnific houseand as soon as she left the stage they call her on
again with applaus onc or twice she was encor five and six time in
success and receiv with hiss when she appear and discharg
with hiss and laughter when she had finishedthen instant encor
and insult again and how the highborn knave enjoy it
whitekid gentlemen and ladi laugh till the tear came and
clap their hand in veri ecstaci when that unhappi old woman would
come meek out for the sixth time with uncomplain patienc to meet
a storm of hiss it was the cruelest exhibitionth most wanton the
most unfeel the singer would have conquer an audienc of american
rowdi by her brave unflinch tranquil for she answer encor
after encor and smile and bow pleasant and sang the best she
possibl could and went bow off through all the jeer and hiss
without ever lose counten or temper and sure in ani other land
than itali her sex and her helpless must have been an ampl
protect to hersh could have need no other think what a
multitud of small soul were crowd into that theatr last night if
the manag could have fill his theatr with neapolitan soul alon
without the bodi he could not have clear less than nineti million
of dollar what trait of charact must a man have to enabl him to
help three thousand miscreant to hiss and jeer and laugh at one
friendless old woman and shame humili her he must have all
the vile mean trait there are my observ persuad me i do not
like to ventur beyond my own person observ that the upper
class of napl possess those trait of charact otherwis they may
be veri good peopl i can not say

in this citi of napl they believ in and support one of the
wretchedest of all the religi impostur one can find in italyth
miracul liquefact of the blood of st januarius twice a year the
priest assembl all the peopl at the cathedr and get out this vial
of clot blood and let them see it slowli dissolv and becom liquid
and everi day for eight day this dismal farc is repeat while the
priest go among the crowd and collect money for the exhibit the
first day the blood liquefi in fortyseven minutesth church is
cram then and time must be allow the collector to get around
after that it liquefi a littl quicker and a littl quicker everi day
as the hous grow smaller till on the eighth day with onli a few
dozen present to see the miracl it liquefi in four minut

and here also they use to have a grand process of priest
citizen soldier sailor and the high dignitari of the citi
govern onc a year to shave the head of a madeup madonnaa
stuf and paint imag like a millin dummywhos hair
miracul grew and restor itself everi twelv month they still
kept up this shave process as late as four or five year ago it
was a sourc of great profit to the church that possess the remark
effigi and the ceremoni of the public barber of her was alway
carri out with the greatest possibl eclat and displayth more the
better becaus the more excit there was about it the larger the
crowd it drew and the heavier the revenu it producedbut at last a
day came when the pope and his servant were unpopular in napl and the
citi govern stop the madonna annual show

there we have two specimen of these neapolitanstwo of the silliest
possibl fraud which half the popul religi and faith
believ and the other half either believ also or els said noth
about and thus lent themselv to the support of the impostur i am
veri well satisfi to think the whole popul believ in those poor
cheap miraclesa peopl who want two cent everi time they bow to you
and who abus a woman are capabl of it i think


ascent of vesuviuscontinu

these neapolitan alway ask four time as much money as they intend to
take but if you give them what they first demand they feel asham of
themselv for aim so low and immedi ask more when money is to
be paid and receiv there is alway some vehement jaw and
gesticul about it one can not buy and pay for two cent worth of
clam without troubl and a quarrel one cours  in a twohors
carriag cost a francthat is lawbut the hackman alway demand
more on some pretenc or other and if he get it he make a new demand
it is said that a stranger took a onehors carriag for a cours
tariff half a franc he gave the man five franc by way of experi
he demand more and receiv anoth franc again he demand more
and got a francdemand more and it was refus he grew vehement
was again refus and becam noisi the stranger said well give me
the seven franc again and i will see what i can doand when he got
them he hand the hackman half a franc and he immedi ask for
two cent to buy a drink with it may be thought that i am prejud

perhap i am i would be asham of myself if i were not

well as i was say we got our mule and hors after an hour and a
half of bargain with the popul of annunci and start
sleepili up the mountain with a vagrant at each mule tail who
pretend to be drive the brute along but was realli hold on and
get himself drag up instead i made slow headway at first but i
began to get dissatisfi at the idea of pay my minion five franc to
hold my mule back by the tail and keep him from go up the hill and so
i discharg him i got along faster then

we had one magnific pictur of napl from a high point on the
mountain side we saw noth but the gas lamp of coursetwothird
of a circl skirt the great baya necklac of diamond glint up
through the dark from the remot distanceless brilliant than the
star overhead but more soft rich beautifuland over all the great
citi the light cross and recross each other in mani and mani a
sparkl line and curv and back of the town far around and abroad
over the mile of level campagna were scatter row and circl and
cluster of light all glow like so mani gem and mark where a
score of villag were sleep about this time the fellow who was
hang on to the tail of the hors in front of me and practic all
sort of unnecessari cruelti upon the anim got kick some fourteen

see napl and die  well i do not know that one would necessarili die
after mere see it but to attempt to live there might turn out a
littl differ to see napl as we saw it in the earli dawn from
far up on the side of vesuvius is to see a pictur of wonder beauti
at that distanc it dingi build look whiteand so rank on rank
of balconi window and roof they pile themselv up from the blue
ocean till the coloss castl of st elmo top the grand white pyramid
and gave the pictur symmetri emphasi and complet and when it
lili turn to roseswhen it blush under the sun first kissit
was beauti beyond all descript one might well say then see
napl and die  the frame of the pictur was charm itself in
front the smooth seaa vast mosaic of mani color the lofti island
swim in a dreami haze in the distanc at our end of the citi the
state doubl peak of vesuvius and it strong black rib and seam of
lava stretch down to the limitless level campagnaa green carpet that
enchant the eye and lead it on and on past cluster of tree and
isol hous and snowi villag until it shred out in a fring of
mist and general vagu far away it is from the hermitag there on
the side of vesuvius that one should see napl and die 

but do not go within the wall and look at it in detail that take away
some of the romanc of the thing the peopl are filthi in their habit
and this make filthi street and breed disagre sight and smell
there never was a communiti so prejud against the cholera as these
neapolitan are but they have good reason to be the cholera general
vanquish a neapolitan when it seiz him becaus you understand
befor the doctor can dig through the dirt and get at the diseas the man
die the upper class take a seabath everi day and are pretti
decent

the street are general about wide enough for one wagon and how they
do swarm with peopl it is broadway repeat in everi street in everi
court in everi alley such mass such throng such multitud of
hurri bustl struggl human we never saw the like of it
hard even in new york i think there are seldom ani sidewalk and
when there are they are not often wide enough to pass a man on without
carom on him so everybodi walk in the streetand where the street
is wide enough carriag are forev dash along whi a thousand
peopl are not run over and crippl everi day is a mysteri that no man
can solv but if there is an eighth wonder in the world it must be the
dwellinghous of napl i honest believ a good major of them
are a hundr feet high and the solid brick wall are seven feet
through you go up nine flight of stair befor you get to the first
floor no not nine but there or thereabout there is a littl
birdcag of an iron rail in front of everi window clear away up up
up among the etern cloud where the roof is and there is alway
somebodi look out of everi windowpeopl of ordinari size look
out from the first floor peopl a shade smaller from the second peopl
that look a littl smaller yet from the thirdand from thenc upward
they grow smaller and smaller by a regular graduat diminut till
the folk in the topmost window seem more like bird in an uncommon
tall martinbox than ani thing els the perspect of one of these
narrow crack of street with it row of tall hous stretch away
till they come togeth in the distanc like railway track it
clotheslin cross over at all altitud and wave their banner
ragged over the swarm of peopl below and the whitedress women
perch in balconi rail all the way from the pavement up to the
heavensa perspect like that is realli worth go into neapolitan
detail to see

napl with it immedi suburb contain six hundr and twentyf
thousand inhabit but i am satisfi it cover no more ground than an
american citi of one hundr and fifti thousand it reach up into the
air infinit higher than three american citi though and there is
where the secret of it lie i will observ here in pass that the
contrast between opul and poverti and magnific and miseri are
more frequent and more strike in napl than in pari even one must
go to the boi de boulogn to see fashion dress splendid
equipag and stun liveri and to the faubourg st antoin to see
vice miseri hunger rag dirtbut in the thoroughfar of napl
these thing are all mix togeth nake boy of nine year and the
fancydress children of luxuri shred and tatter and brilliant
uniform jackasscart and statecarriag beggar princ and
bishop jostl each other in everi street at six oclock everi
even all napl turn out to drive on the rivier di chiaja
whatev that may mean and for two hour one may stand there and see
the motliest and the worst mix process go by that ever eye beheld
princ there are more princ than policemen in naplesth citi is
infest with them princ who live up seven flight of stair and
dont own ani princip will keep a carriag and go hungri and
clerk mechan millin and strumpet will go without their dinner
and squander the money on a hackrid in the chiaja the ragtag and
rubbish of the citi stack themselv up to the number of twenti or
thirti on a ricketi littl gocart haul by a donkey not much bigger
than a cat and they drive in the chiaja duke and banker in sumptuous
carriag and with gorgeous driver and footmen turn out also and so
the furious process goe for two hour rank and wealth and
obscur and poverti clatter along side by side in the wild process
and then go home seren happi cover with glori

i was look at a magnific marbl staircas in the king palac the
other day which it was said cost five million franc and i suppos it
did cost half a million may be i felt as if it must be a fine thing to
live in a countri where there was such comfort and such luxuri as this
and then i step out muse and almost walk over a vagabond who was
eat his dinner on the curbstonea piec of bread and a bunch of
grape when i found that this mustang was clerk in a fruit
establish he had the establish along with him in a basket at
two cent a day and that he had no palac at home where he live i lost
some of my enthusiasm concern the happi of live in itali

this natur suggest to me a thought about wage here lieuten in
the armi get about a dollar a day and common soldier a coupl of cent
i onli know one clerkh get four dollar a month printer get six
dollar and a half a month but i have heard of a foreman who get
thirteen

to be grow sudden and violent rich as this man is natur
make him a bloat aristocrat the air he put on are insuffer

and speak of wage remind me of price of merchandis in pari
you pay twelv dollar a dozen for jouvin best kid glove glove of
about as good qualiti sell here at three or four dollar a dozen you
pay five and six dollar apiec for fine linen shirt in pari here and
in leghorn you pay two and a half in marseill you pay forti dollar
for a firstclass dress coat made by a good tailor but in leghorn you
can get a full dress suit for the same money here you get handsom
busi suit at from ten to twenti dollar and in leghorn you can get
an overcoat for fifteen dollar that would cost you seventi in new york
fine kid boot are worth eight dollar in marseill and four dollar
here lyon velvet rank higher in america than those of genoa yet the
bulk of lyon velvet you buy in the state are made in genoa and
import into lyon where they receiv the lyon stamp and are then
export to america you can buy enough velvet in genoa for twentyf
dollar to make a five hundr dollar cloak in new yorkso the ladi
tell me of cours these thing bring me back by a natur and easi
transit to the

ascent of vesuviuscontinu

and thus the wonder blue grotto is suggest to me it is situat on
the island of capri twentytwo mile from napl we charter a littl
steamer and went out there of cours the polic board us and put us
through a health examin and inquir into our polit befor they
would let us land the air these littl insect govern put on are
in the last degre ridicul they even put a policeman on board of our
boat to keep an eye on us as long as we were in the capri dominion
they thought we want to steal the grotto i suppos it was worth
steal the entranc to the cave is four feet high and four feet wide
and is in the face of a lofti perpendicular cliffth seawal you
enter in small boatsand a tight squeez it is too you can not go in
at all when the tide is up onc within you find yourself in an arch
cavern about one hundr and sixti feet long one hundr and twenti
wide and about seventi high how deep it is no man know it goe down
to the bottom of the ocean the water of this placid subterranean lake
are the brightest loveliest blue that can be imagin they are as
transpar as plate glass and their color would shame the richest
sky that ever bent over itali no tint could be more ravish no
lustr more superb throw a stone into the water and the myriad of tini
bubbl that are creat flash out a brilliant glare like blue theatric
fire dip an oar and it blade turn to splendid frost silver
tint with blue let a man jump in and instant he is case in an
armor more gorgeous than ever king crusad wore

then we went to ischia but i had alreadi been to that island and tire
myself to death resting a coupl of day and studi human villaini
with the landlord of the grand sentinell for a model so we went to
procida and from thenc to pozzuoli where st paul land after he
sail from samo i land at precis the same spot where st paul
land and so did dan and the other it was a remark coincid
st paul preach to these peopl seven day befor he start to rome

nero bath the ruin of baiae the templ of serapi cuma where the
cumaen sybil interpret the oracl the lake agnano with it ancient
submerg citi still visibl far down in it depthsthes and a hundr
other point of interest we examin with critic imbecil but the
grotto of the dog claim our chief attent becaus we had heard and
read so much about it everi bodi has written about the grotto del cane
and it poison vapor from plini down to smith and everi tourist has
held a dog over it floor by the leg to test the capabl of the
place the dog die in a minut and a halfa chicken instant as a
general thing stranger who crawl in there to sleep do not get up until
they are call and then they dont either the stranger that ventur
to sleep there take a perman contract i long to see this grotto
i resolv to take a dog and hold him myself suffoc him a littl and
time him suffoc him some more and then finish him we reach the
grotto at about three in the afternoon and proceed at onc to make the
experi but now an import difficulti present itself we had
no dog

ascent of vesuviuscontinu

at the hermitag we were about fifteen or eighteen hundr feet abov the
sea and thus far a portion of the ascent had been pretti abrupt for
the next two mile the road was a mixturesometim the ascent was
abrupt and sometim it was not but one characterist it possess all
the time without failurewithout modificationit was all
uncompromis and unspeak infam it was a rough narrow trail
and led over an old lava flowa black ocean which was tumbl into a
thousand fantast shapesa wild chao of ruin desol and
barrennessa wilder of billowi upheav of furious whirlpool of
miniatur mountain rent asunderof gnarl and knot wrinkl and
twist mass of black that mimick branch root great vine
trunk of tree all interlac and mingl togeth and all these weird
shape all this turbul panorama all this stormi farstretch
wast of black with it thrill suggest of life of action
of boil surg furious motion was petrifi all stricken dead
and cold in the instant of it maddest riot fetter paralyz and
left to glower at heaven in impot rage for evermor

final we stood in a level narrow valley a valley that had been
creat by the terrif march of some old time irrupt and on either
hand tower the two steep peak of vesuvius the one we had to climb
the one that contain the activ volcanoseem about eight hundr or
one thousand feet high and look almost too straightupanddown for
ani man to climb and certain no mule could climb it with a man on his
back four of these nativ pirat will carri you to the top in a sedan
chair if you wish it but suppos they were to slip and let you fall
is it like that you would ever stop roll not this side of
etern perhap we left the mule sharpen our fingernail and
began the ascent i have been write about so long at twenti minut to
six in the morn the path led straight up a rug sweep of loos
chunk of pumiceston and for about everi two step forward we took we
slid back one it was so excess steep that we had to stop everi
fifti or sixti step and rest a moment to see our comrad we had to
look veri near straight up at those abov us and veri near straight
down at those below we stood on the summit at lastit had taken an
hour and fifteen minut to make the trip

what we saw there was simpli a circular cratera circular ditch if you
pleaseabout two hundr feet deep and four or five hundr feet wide
whose inner wall was about half a mile in circumfer in the centr
of the great circus ring thus form was a torn and rag upheav a
hundr feet high all snow over with a sulphur crust of mani and mani
a brilliant and beauti color and the ditch inclos this like the
moat of a castl or surround it as a littl river doe a littl
island if the simil is better the sulphur coat of that island was
gaudi in the extremeal mingl togeth in the richest confus were
red blue brown black yellow whitei do not know that there was a
color or shade of a color or combin of color unrepresentedand
when the sun burst through the morn mist and fire this tint
magnific it top imperi vesuvius like a jewel crown

the crater itselfth ditchwa not so varieg in color but yet
in it soft rich and unpretenti eleg it was more
charm more fascin to the eye there was noth loud about
it wellbr and wellcreas look beauti one could stand and
look down upon it for a week without get tire of it it had the
semblanc of a pleasant meadow whose slender grass and whose velveti
moss were frost with a shine dust and tint with palest green
that deepen gradual to the darkest hue of the orang leaf and
deepen yet again into gravest brown then fade into orang then into
brightest gold and culmin in the delic pink of a newblown rose
where portion of the meadow had sunk and where other portion had been
broken up like an iceflo the cavern open of the one and the
rag upturn edg expos by the other were hung with a lacework of
softtint crystal of sulphur that chang their deform into
quaint shape and figur that were full of grace and beauti

the wall of the ditch were brilliant with yellow bank of sulphur and
with lava and pumiceston of mani color no fire was visibl ani
where but gust of sulphur steam issu silent and invis from a
thousand littl crack and fissur in the crater and were waft to our
nose with everi breez but so long as we kept our nostril buri in
our handkerchief there was small danger of suffoc

some of the boy thrust long slip of paper down into hole and set them
on fire and so achiev the glori of light their cigar by the flame
of vesuvius and other cook egg over fissur in the rock and were
happi

the view from the summit would have been superb but for the fact that the
sun could onli pierc the mist at long interv thus the glimps we
had of the grand panorama below were onli fit and unsatisfactori

the descent

the descent of the mountain was a labor of onli four minut instead of
stalk down the rug path we ascend we chose one which was bed
kneedeep in loos ash and plough our way with prodigi stride
that would almost have shame the perform of him of the sevenleagu
boot

the vesuvius of today is a veri poor affair compar to the mighti
volcano of kilauea in the sandwich island but i am glad i visit it
it was well worth it

it is said that dure one of the grand erupt of vesuvius it
discharg massi rock weigh mani ton a thousand feet into the air
it vast jet of smoke and steam ascend thirti mile toward the
firmament and cloud of it ash were waft abroad and fell upon the
deck of ship seven hundr and fifti mile at sea i will take the
ash at a moder discount if ani one will take the thirti mile of
smoke but i do not feel abl to take a command interest in the whole
stori by myself




chapter xxxi

the buri citi of pompeii

they pronounc it pompay i alway had an idea that you went down
into pompeii with torch by the way of damp dark stairway just as
you do in silver mine and travers gloomi tunnel with lava overhead
and someth on either hand like dilapid prison goug out of the
solid earth that faint resembl hous but you do noth the kind
fulli onehalf of the buri citi perhap is complet exhum and
thrown open freeli to the light of day and there stand the long row of
solidlybuilt brick hous roofless just as they stood eighteen hundr
year ago hot with the flame sun and there lie their floor
cleanswept and not a bright fragment tarnish or wait of the
labor mosaic that pictur them with the beast and bird and
flower which we copi in perish carpet today and here are the
venus and bacchus and adonis make love and get drunk in
manyhu fresco on the wall of saloon and bedchamb and there are
the narrow street and narrow sidewalk pave with flag of good hard
lava the one deepli rut with the chariotwheel and the other with
the pass feet of the pompeiian of bygon centuri and there are
the bakeshop the templ the hall of justic the bath the
theatresal cleanscrap and neat and suggest noth of the
natur of a silver mine away down in the bowel of the earth the
broken pillar lie about the doorless doorway and the crumbl top
of the wilder of wall were wonder suggest of the burnt
district in one of our citi and if there had been ani char
timber shatter window heap of debri and general black and
smoki about the place the resembl would have been perfect but
noth sun shine as bright down on old pompeii today as it did when
christ was born in bethlehem and it street are cleaner a hundr
time than ever pompeiian saw them in her prime i know whereof i
speakfor in the great chief thoroughfar merchant street and the
street of fortun have i not seen with my own eye how for two hundr
year at least the pavement were not repair how rut five and even
ten inch deep were worn into the thick flagston by the
chariotwheel of generat of swindl taxpay and do i not know
by these sign that street commission of pompeii never attend to
their busi and that if they never mend the pavement they never
clean them and besid is it not the inborn natur of street
commission to avoid their duti whenev they get a chanc i wish i
knew the name of the last one that held offic in pompeii so that i
could give him a blast i speak with feel on this subject becaus i
caught my foot in one of those rut and the sad that came over me
when i saw the first poor skeleton with ash and lava stick to it
was temper by the reflect that may be that parti was the street
commission

nopompeii is no longer a buri citi it is a citi of hundr and
hundr of roofless hous and a tangl maze of street where one
could easili get lost without a guid and have to sleep in some ghost
palac that had known no live tenant sinc that aw novemb night of
eighteen centuri ago

we pass through the gate which face the mediterranean call the
marin gate  and by the rusti broken imag of minerva still keep
tireless watch and ward over the possess it was powerless to save
and went up a long street and stood in the broad court of the forum of
justic the floor was level and clean and up and down either side was
a nobl colonnad of broken pillar with their beauti ionic and
corinthian column scatter about them at the upper end were the
vacant seat of the judg and behind them we descend into a dungeon
where the ash and cinder had found two prison chain on that
memor novemb night and tortur them to death how they must have
tug at the pitiless fetter as the fierc fire surg around them

then we loung through mani and mani a sumptuous privat mansion which
we could not have enter without a formal invit in incomprehens
latin in the olden time when the owner live thereand we probabl
wouldnt have got it these peopl built their hous a good deal alik
the floor were laid in fanci figur wrought in mosaic of
manycolor marbl at the threshold your eye fall upon a latin
sentenc of welcom sometim or a pictur of a dog with the legend
bewar of the dog  and sometim a pictur of a bear or a faun with no
inscript at all then you enter a sort of vestibul where they use
to keep the hatrack i suppos next a room with a larg marbl basin
in the midst and the pipe of a fountain on either side are bedroom
beyond the fountain is a receptionroom then a littl garden
diningroom and so forth and so on the floor were all mosaic the
wall were stucco or fresco or ornament with basrelief and
here and there were statu larg and small and littl fishpool and
cascad of sparkl water that sprang from secret place in the
colonnad of handsom pillar that surround the court and kept the
flowerb fresh and the air cool those pompeiian were veri
luxuri in their tast and habit the most exquisit bronz we
have seen in europ came from the exhum citi of herculaneum and
pompeii and also the finest cameo and the most delic engrav on
precious stone their pictur eighteen or nineteen centuri old are
often much more pleas than the celebr rubbish of the old master
of three centuri ago they were well up in art from the creation of
these work of the first clear up to the eleventh centuri art seem
hard to have exist at allat least no remnant of it are leftand
it was curious to see how far in some thing at ani rate these old
time pagan excel the remot generat of master that came after
them the pride of the world in sculptur seem to be the laocoon and
the die gladiat in rome they are as old as pompeii were dug from
the earth like pompeii but their exact age or who made them can onli be
conjectur but worn and crack without a histori and with the
blemish stain of numberless centuri upon them they still mute
mock at all effort to rival their perfect

it was a quaint and curious pastim wander through this old silent
citi of the deadloung through utter desert street where
thousand and thousand of human be onc bought and sold and walk
and rode and made the place resound with the nois and confus of
traffic and pleasur they were not lazi they hurri in those day
we had evid of that there was a templ on one corner and it was a
shorter cut to go between the column of that templ from one street to
the other than to go aroundand behold that pathway had been worn deep
into the heavi flagston floor of the build by generat of
timesav feet they would not go around when it was quicker to go
through we do that way in our citi

everi where you see thing that make you wonder how old these old hous
were befor the night of destruct cameth too which bring back
those long dead inhabit and place the live befor your eye for
instanc the step two feet thicklava block that lead up out of the
school and the same kind of step that lead up into the dress circl of
the princip theatr are almost worn through for age the boy
hurri out of that school and for age their parent hurri into that
theatr and the nervous feet that have been dust and ash for eighteen
centuri have left their record for us to read today i imagin i
could see crowd of gentlemen and ladi throng into the theatr with
ticket for secur seat in their hand and on the wall i read the
imaginari placard in infam grammar posit no free list except
member of the press  hang about the doorway i fanci were
slouchi pompeiian streetboy utter slang and profan and keep a
wari eye out for check i enter the theatr and sat down in one of
the long row of stone bench in the dress circl and look at the
place for the orchestra and the ruin stage and around at the wide
sweep of empti box and thought to myself this hous wont pay  i
tri to imagin the music in full blast the leader of the orchestra
beat time and the versatile soandso who had just return from
a most success tour in the provinc to play his last and farewel
engag of posit six night onli in pompeii previous to his
departur for herculaneum  charg around the stage and pile the
agoni mountain highbut i could not do it with such a house as that
those empti bench tie my fanci down to dull realiti i said these
peopl that ought to be here have been dead and still and molder to
dust for age and age and will never care for the trifl and folli
of life ani more for everow to circumst etc etc there
will not be ani perform tonight  close down the curtain put out
the light

and so i turn away and went through shop after shop and store after
store far down the long street of the merchant and call for the
ware of rome and the east but the tradesmen were gone the mart were
silent and noth was left but the broken jar all set in cement of
cinder and ash the wine and the oil that onc had fill them were
gone with their owner

in a bakeshop was a mill for grind the grain and the furnac for
bake the bread and they say that here in the same furnac the
exhum of pompeii found nice well bake loav which the baker had not
found time to remov from the oven the last time he left his shop
becaus circumst compel him to leav in such a hurri

in one hous the onli build in pompeii which no woman is now allow
to enter were the small room and short bed of solid masonri just as
they were in the old time and on the wall were pictur which look
almost as fresh as if they were paint yesterday but which no pen could
have the hardihood to describ and here and there were latin
inscriptionsobscen scintil of wit scratch by hand that
possibl were uplift to heaven for succor in the midst of a drive
storm of fire befor the night was done

in one of the princip street was a ponder stone tank and a
waterspout that suppli it and where the tire heat toiler from the
campagna use to rest their right hand when they bent over to put their
lip to the spout the thick stone was worn down to a broad groov an
inch or two deep think of the countless thousand of hand that had
press that spot in the age that are gone to so reduc a stone that
is as hard as iron

they had a great public bulletin board in pompeiia place where
announc for gladiatori combat elect and such thing were
postednot on perish paper but carv in endur stone one ladi
who i take it was rich and well brought up advertis a dwell or so
to rent with bath and all the modern improv and sever hundr
shop stipul that the dwell should not be put to immor
purpos you can find out who live in mani a hous in pompeii by the
carv stone doorplat affix to them and in the same way you can
tell who they were that occupi the tomb everi where around are thing
that reveal to you someth of the custom and histori of this forgotten
peopl but what would a volcano leav of an american citi if it onc
rain it cinder on it hard a sign or a symbol to tell it stori

in one of these long pompeiian hall the skeleton of a man was found
with ten piec of gold in one hand and a larg key in the other he had
seiz his money and start toward the door but the fieri tempest
caught him at the veri threshold and he sank down and die one more
minut of precious time would have save him i saw the skeleton of a
man a woman and two young girl the woman had her hand spread wide
apart as if in mortal terror and i imagin i could still trace upon
her shapeless face someth of the express of wild despair that
distort it when the heaven rain fire in these street so mani age
ago the girl and the man lay with their face upon their arm as if
they had tri to shield them from the envelop cinder in one
apart eighteen skeleton were found all in sit postur and
blacken place on the wall still mark their shape and show their
attitud like shadow one of them a woman still wore upon her
skeleton throat a necklac with her name engrav upon itjuli di
diomed

but perhap the most poetic thing pompeii has yield to modern
research was that grand figur of a roman soldier clad in complet
armor who true to his duti true to his proud name of a soldier of
rome and full of the stern courag which had given to that name it
glori stood to his post by the citi gate erect and unflinch till
the hell that rage around him burn out the dauntless spirit it could
not conquer

we never read of pompeii but we think of that soldier we can not write
of pompeii without the natur impuls to grant to him the mention he so
well deserv let us rememb that he was a soldiernot a policeman
and so prais him be a soldier he staid becaus the warrior
instinct forbad him to fli had he been a policeman he would have
staid alsobecaus he would have been asleep

there are not half a dozen flight of stair in pompeii and no other
evid that the hous were more than one stori high the peopl did
not live in the cloud as do the venetian the genoes and neapolitan
of today

we came out from under the solemn mysteri of this citi of the vener
pastthi citi which perish with all it old way and it quaint old
fashion about it remot centuri ago when the discipl were
preach the new religion which is as old as the hill to us nowand
went dream among the tree that grow over acr and acr of it still
buri street and squar till a shrill whistl and the cri of all
aboardlast train for napl  woke me up and remind me that i
belong in the nineteenth centuri and was not a dusti mummi cake with
ash and cinder eighteen hundr year old the transit was
startl the idea of a railroad train actual run to old dead
pompeii and whistl irrever and call for passeng in the
most bustl and businesslik way was as strang a thing as one could
imagin and as unpoet and disagre as it was strang

compar the cheer life and the sunshin of this day with the horror
the younger plini saw here the th of novemb a d  when he was so
brave strive to remov his mother out of reach of harm while she
beg him with all a mother unselfish to leav her to perish and
save himself

by this time the murki dark had so increas that one might
have believ himself abroad in a black and moonless night or in a
chamber where all the light had been extinguish on everi hand
was heard the complaint of women the wail of children and the
cri of men one call his father anoth his son and anoth
his wife and onli by their voic could they know each other mani
in their despair beg that death would come and end their
distress

some implor the god to succor them and some believ that this
night was the last the etern night which should engulf the
univers

even so it seem to meand i consol myself for the come death
with the reflect behold the world is pass away 

       

after brows among the state ruin of rome of baiae of pompeii and
after glanc down the long marbl rank of batter and nameless

chapter xxxii

home again for the first time in mani week the ship entir famili
met and shook hand on the quarterdeck they had gather from mani
point of the compass and from mani land but not one was miss there
was no tale of sick or death among the flock to dampen the pleasur
of the reunion onc more there was a full audienc on deck to listen to
the sailor chorus as they got the anchor up and to wave an adieu to
the land as we sped away from napl the seat were full at dinner
again the domino parti were complet and the life and bustl on the
upper deck in the fine moonlight at night was like old timesold time
that had been gone week onli but yet they were week so crowd with
incid adventur and excit that they seem almost like year
there was no lack of cheer on board the quaker citi for onc
her titl was a misnom

at seven in the even with the western horizon all golden from the
sunken sun and speck with distant ship the full moon sail high
over head the dark blue of the sea under foot and a strang sort of
twilight affect by all these differ light and color around us and
about us we sight superb stromboli with what majesti the monarch
held his lone state abov the level sea distanc cloth him in a
purpl gloom and ad a veil of shimmer mist that so soften his
rug featur that we seem to see him through a web of silver gauz
his torch was out his fire were smolder a tall column of smoke that
rose up and lost itself in the grow moonlight was all the sign he gave
that he was a live autocrat of the sea and not the spectr of a dead
one

at two in the morn we swept through the strait of messina and so
bright was the moonlight that itali on the one hand and sicili on the
other seem almost as distinct visibl as though we look at them
from the middl of a street we were travers the citi of messina
milkwhit and star and spangl all over with gaslight was a fairi
spectacl a great parti of us were on deck smoke and make a nois
and wait to see famous scylla and charybdi and present the oracl
step out with his etern spyglass and squar himself on the deck
like anoth colossus of rhode it was a surpris to see him abroad at
such an hour nobodi suppos he care anyth about an old fabl like
that of scylla and charybdi one of the boy said

hello doctor what are you do up here at this time of night what
do you want to see this place for 

what do i want to see this place for young man littl do you know me
or you wouldnt ask such a question i wish to see all the place that
mention in the bibl 

stuffthi place isnt mention in the bibl 

it aint mention in the bibl this place aintwel now what place
is this sinc you know so much about it 

whi it scylla and charybdi 

scylla and chaconfound it i thought it was sodom and gomorrah 

and he close up his glass and went below the abov is the ship stori
it plausibl is mar a littl by the fact that the oracl was not a
biblic student and did not spend much of his time instruct himself
about scriptur local they say the oracl complain in this hot
weather late that the onli beverag in the ship that is passabl is
the butter he did not mean butter of cours but inasmuch as that
articl remain in a melt state now sinc we are out of ice it is fair
to give him the credit of get one long word in the right place
anyhow for onc in his life he said in rome that the pope was a
noblelook old man but he never did think much of his iliad

we spent one pleasant day skirt along the isl of greec they are
veri mountain their prevail tint are gray and brown approach
to red littl white villag surround by tree nestl in the valley
or roost upon the lofti perpendicular seawal

we had one fine sunseta rich carmin flush that suffus the western
sky and cast a ruddi glow far over the sea fine sunset seem to be
rare in this part of the worldor at least strike one they are
soft sensuous lovelythey are exquisit refin effemin but we
have seen no sunset here yet like the gorgeous conflagr that flame
in the track of the sink sun in our high northern latitud

but what were sunset to us with the wild excit upon us of
approach the most renown of citi what care we for outward
vision when agamemnon achill and a thousand other hero of the
great past were march in ghost process through our fanci what
were sunset to us who were about to live and breath and walk in actual
athen yea and go far down into the dead centuri and bid in person
for the slave diogen and plato in the public marketplac or gossip
with the neighbor about the sieg of troy or the splendid deed of
marathon we scorn to consid sunset

we arriv and enter the ancient harbor of the piraeus at last we
drop anchor within half a mile of the villag away off across the
undul plain of attica could be seen a littl squaretop hill
with a someth on it which our glass soon discov to be the
ruin edific of the citadel of the athenian and most promin among
them loom the vener parthenon so exquisit clear and pure is
this wonder atmospher that everi column of the nobl structur was
discern through the telescop and even the smaller ruin about it
assum some semblanc of shape this at a distanc of five or six
mile in the valley near the acropoli the squaretop hill befor
spoken of athen itself could be vagu made out with an ordinari
lorgnett everi bodi was anxious to get ashor and visit these classic
local as quick as possibl no land we had yet seen had arous
such univers interest among the passeng

but bad news came the command of the piraeus came in his boat and
said we must either depart or els get outsid the harbor and remain
imprison in our ship under rigid quarantin for eleven day so we
took up the anchor and move outsid to lie a dozen hour or so take
in suppli and then sail for constantinopl it was the bitterest
disappoint we had yet experienc to lie a whole day in sight of
the acropoli and yet be oblig to go away without visit athen
disappoint was hard a strong enough word to describ the
circumst

all hand were on deck all the afternoon with book and map and
glass tri to determin which narrow rocki ridge was the
areopagus which slope hill the pnyx which elev the museum hill
and so on and we got thing confus discuss becam heat and
parti spirit ran high church member were gaze with emot upon a
hill which they said was the one st paul preach from and anoth
faction claim that that hill was hymettus and anoth that it was
pentelicon after all the troubl we could be certain of onli one
thingth squaretop hill was the acropoli and the grand ruin that
crown it was the parthenon whose pictur we knew in infanc in the
school book

we inquir of everi bodi who came near the ship whether there were
guard in the piraeus whether they were strict what the chanc were of
captur should ani of us slip ashor and in case ani of us made the
ventur and were caught what would be probabl done to us the answer
were discourag there was a strong guard or polic forc the piraeus
was a small town and ani stranger seen in it would sure attract
attentioncaptur would be certain the command said the punish
would be heavi  when ask how heavi  he said it would be veri
severethat was all we could get out of him

at eleven oclock at night when most of the ship compani were abe
four of us stole soft ashor in a small boat a cloud moon favor
the enterpris and start two and two and far apart over a low hill
intend to go clear around the piraeus out of the rang of it polic
pick our way so stealthili over that rocki nettlegrown emin
made me feel a good deal as if i were on my way somewher to steal
someth my immedi comrad and i talk in an underton about
quarantin law and their penalti but we found noth cheer in the
subject i was post onli a few day befor i was talk with our
captain and he mention the case of a man who swam ashor from a
quarantin ship somewher and got imprison six month for it and
when he was in genoa a few year ago a captain of a quarantin ship
went in his boat to a depart ship which was alreadi outsid of the
harbor and put a letter on board to be taken to his famili and the
author imprison him three month for it and then conduct him
and his ship fair to sea and warn him never to show himself in that
port again while he live this kind of convers did no good
further than to give a sort of dismal interest to our quarantinebreak
expedit and so we drop it we made the entir circuit of the town
without see ani bodi but one man who stare at us curious but said
noth and a dozen person asleep on the ground befor their door
whom we walk among and never wokebut we woke up dog enough in all
consciencew alway had one or two bark at our heel and sever
time we had as mani as ten and twelv at onc they made such a
preposter din that person aboard our ship said they could tell how we
were progress for a long time and where we were by the bark of
the dog the cloud moon still favor us when we had made the whole
circuit and were pass among the hous on the further side of the
town the moon came out splendid but we no longer fear the light
as we approach a well near a hous to get a drink the owner mere
glanc at us and went within he left the quiet slumber town at our
merci i record it here proud that we didnt do ani thing to it

see no road we took a tall hill to the left of the distant acropoli
for a mark and steer straight for it over all obstruct and over a
littl rougher piec of countri than exist ani where els outsid of the
state of nevada perhap part of the way it was cover with small
loos stonesw trod on six at a time and they all roll anoth
part of it was dri loos newlyplough ground still anoth part of
it was a long stretch of low grapevin which were tanglesom and
troublesom and which we took to be brambl the attic plain bar
the grapevin was a barren desol unpoet wastei wonder what
it was in greec age of glori five hundr year befor christ

in the neighborhood of one oclock in the morn when we were heat
with fast walk and parch with thirst denni exclaim whi these
weed are grapevin  and in five minut we had a score of bunch of
larg white delici grape and were reach down for more when a
dark shape rose mysteri up out of the shadow besid us and said
ho  and so we left

in ten minut more we struck into a beauti road and unlik some
other we had stumbl upon at interv it led in the right direct
we follow it it was broad and smooth and whitehandsom and in
perfect repair and shade on both side for a mile or so with singl
rank of tree and also with luxuri vineyard twice we enter and
stole grape and the second time somebodi shout at us from some
invis place whereupon we left again we specul in grape no
more on that side of athen

short we came upon an ancient stone aqueduct built upon arch and
from that time forth we had ruin all about usw were approach our
journey end we could not see the acropoli now or the high hill
either and i want to follow the road till we were abreast of them but
the other overrul me and we toil labori up the stoni hill
immedi in our frontand from it summit saw anotherclimb it and
saw anoth it was an hour of exhaust work soon we came upon a row
of open grave cut in the solid rock for a while one of them serv
socrat for a prison we pass around the shoulder of the hill and
the citadel in all it ruin magnific burst upon us we hurri
across the ravin and up a wind road and stood on the old acropoli
with the prodigi wall of the citadel tower abov our head we
did not stop to inspect their massiv block of marbl or measur their
height or guess at their extraordinari thick but pass at onc
through a great arch passag like a railway tunnel and went straight
to the gate that lead to the ancient templ it was lock so after
all it seem that we were not to see the great parthenon face to face
we sat down and held a council of war result the gate was onli a
flimsi structur of woodw would break it down it seem like
desecr but then we had travel far and our necess were
urgent we could not hunt up guid and keepersw must be on the ship
befor daylight so we argu this was all veri fine but when we came
to break the gate we could not do it we move around an angl of the
wall and found a low bastioneight feet high withoutten or twelv
within denni prepar to scale it and we got readi to follow by dint
of hard scrambl he final straddl the top but some loos stone
crumbl away and fell with a crash into the court within there was
instant a bang of door and a shout denni drop from the wall in
a twinkl and we retreat in disord to the gate xerx took that
mighti citadel four hundr and eighti year befor christ when his five
million of soldier and campfollow follow him to greec and if we
four american could have remain unmolest five minut longer we
would have taken it too

the garrison had turn outfour greek we clamor at the gate and
they admit us briberi and corrupt 

we cross a larg court enter a great door and stood upon a pavement
of purest white marbl deepli worn by footprint befor us in the
flood moonlight rose the noblest ruin we had ever look uponth
propyla a small templ of minerva the templ of hercul and the
grand parthenon we got these name from the greek guid who didnt
seem to know more than seven men ought to know  these edific were all
built of the whitest pentel marbl but have a pinkish stain upon them
now where ani part is broken howev the fractur look like fine
loaf sugar six caryatid or marbl women clad in flow robe
support the portico of the templ of hercul but the portico and
colonnad of the other structur are form of massiv doric and ionic
pillar whose flute and capit are still measur perfect
notwithstand the centuri that have gone over them and the sieg
they have suffer the parthenon origin was two hundr and
twentysix feet long one hundr wide and seventi high and had two
row of great column eight in each at either end and singl row of
seventeen each down the side and was one of the most grace and
beauti edific ever erect

most of the parthenon impos column are still stand but the roof
is gone it was a perfect build two hundr and fifti year ago when
a shell drop into the venetian magazin store here and the explos
which follow wreck and unroof it i rememb but littl about the
parthenon and i have put in one or two fact and figur for the use of
other peopl with short memori got them from the guidebook

as we wander thought down the marblepav length of this state
templ the scene about us was strang impress here and there in
lavish profus were gleam white statu of men and women prop
against block of marbl some of them armless some without leg other
headlessbut all look mourn in the moonlight and startl
human they rose up and confront the midnight intrud on everi side
they stare at him with stoni eye from unlookedfor nook and recess
they peer at him over fragmentari heap far down the desol
corridor they bar his way in the midst of the broad forum and
solemn point with handless arm the way from the sacr fane and
through the roofless templ the moon look down and band the floor
and darken the scatter fragment and broken statu with the slant
shadow of the column

what a world of ruin sculptur was about us set up in rowsstack
up in pilesscatt broadcast over the wide area of the acropoli
were hundr of crippl statu of all size and of the most exquisit
workmanship and vast fragment of marbl that onc belong to the
entablatur cover with basrelief repres battl and sieg
ship of war with three and four tier of oar pageant and process
everi thing one could think of histori say that the templ of the
acropoli were fill with the noblest work of praxitel and phidia
and of mani a great master in sculptur besidesand sure these eleg
fragment attest it

we walk out into the grassgrown fragmentstrewn court beyond the
parthenon it startl us everi now and then to see a stoni white face
stare sudden up at us out of the grass with it dead eye the place
seem aliv with ghost i half expect to see the athenian hero of
twenti centuri ago glide out of the shadow and steal into the old
templ they knew so well and regard with such boundless pride

the full moon was ride high in the cloudless heaven now we
saunter careless and unthink to the edg of the lofti
battlement of the citadel and look downa vision and such a
vision athen by moonlight the prophet that thought the splendor of
the new jerusalem were reveal to him sure saw this instead it lay
in the level plain right under our feetal spread abroad like a
pictureand we look down upon it as we might have look from a
balloon we saw no semblanc of a street but everi hous everi window
everi cling vine everi project was as distinct and sharpli mark
as if the time were noonday and yet there was no glare no glitter
noth harsh or repulsiveth noiseless citi was flood with the
mellowest light that ever stream from the moon and seem like some
live creatur wrap in peac slumber on it further side was a
littl templ whose delic pillar and ornat front glow with a rich
lustr that chain the eye like a spell and nearer by the palac of
the king rear it creami wall out of the midst of a great garden of
shrubberi that was fleck all over with a random shower of amber light
a spray of golden spark that lost their bright in the glori of the
moon and glint soft upon the sea of dark foliag like the pallid
star of the milkyway overhead the state column majest still in
their ruinund foot the dream cityin the distanc the silver sea
not on the broad earth is there an other pictur half so beauti

as we turn and move again through the templ i wish that the
illustri men who had sat in it in the remot age could visit it again
and reveal themselv to our curious eyesplato aristotl demosthen
socrat phocion pythagora euclid pindar xenophon herodotus
praxitel and phidia zeuxi the painter what a constel of
celebr name but more than all i wish that old diogen grope
so patient with his lantern search so zealous for one solitari
honest man in all the world might meander along and stumbl on our
parti i ought not to say it may be but still i suppos he would have
put out his light

we left the parthenon to keep it watch over old athen as it had kept
it for twentythre hundr year and went and stood outsid the wall
of the citadel in the distanc was the ancient but still almost
perfect templ of theseus and close by look to the west was the
bema from whenc demosthen thunder his philipp and fire the
waver patriot of his countrymen to the right was mar hill where
the areopagus sat in ancient time and where st paul defin his
posit and below was the marketplac where he disput daily with
the gossiplov athenian we climb the stone step st paul
ascend and stood in the squarecut place he stood in and tri to
recollect the bibl account of the matterbut for certain reason i
could not recal the word i have found them sinc

now while paul wait for them at athen his spirit was stir in
him when he saw the citi wholli given up to idolatri therefor
disput he in the synagogu with the jew and with the devout
person and in the market daili with them that met with him
        
and they took him and brought him unto areopagus say may we
know what this new doctrin whereof thou speakest is
        
then paul stood in the midst of mar hill and said ye men of
athen i perceiv that in all thing ye are too superstiti for
as i pass by and beheld your devot i found an altar with this
inscript to the unknown god whom therefor ye ignor
worship him declar i unto you act ch xvii 

it occur to us after a while that if we want to get home befor
daylight betray us we had better be move so we hurri away when
far on our road we had a part view of the parthenon with the
moonlight stream through it open colonnad and touch it capit
with silver as it look then solemn grand and beauti it will
alway remain in our memori

as we march along we began to get over our fear and ceas to care
much about quarantin scout or ani bodi els we grew bold and
reckless and onc in a sudden burst of courag i even threw a stone at
a dog it was a pleasant reflect though that i did not hit him
becaus his master might just possibl have been a policeman inspir
by this happi failur my valor becam utter uncontrol and at
interv i absolut whistl though on a moder key but bold
breed bold and short i plung into a vineyard in the full light
of the moon and captur a gallon of superb grape not even mind the
presenc of a peasant who rode by on a mule denni and birch follow my
exampl

now i had grape enough for a dozen but then jackson was all swollen up
with courag too and he was oblig to enter a vineyard present the
first bunch he seiz brought troubl a frowsi beard brigand sprang
into the road with a shout and flourish a musket in the light of the
moon we sidl toward the piraeusnot run you understand but onli
advanc with celer the brigand shout again but still we
advanc it was get late and we had no time to fool away on everi
ass that want to drivel greek platitud to us we would just as soon
have talk with him as not if we had not been in a hurri present
denni said those fellow are follow us 

we turn and sure enough there they werethre fantast pirat
arm with gun we slacken our pace to let them come up and in the
meantim i got out my cargo of grape and drop them firm but
reluct into the shadow by the waysid but i was not afraid i
onli felt that it was not right to steal grape and all the more so
when the owner was aroundand not onli around but with his friend
around also the villain came up and search a bundl dr birch had in
his hand and scowl upon him when they found it had noth in it but
some holi rock from mar hill and these were not contraband they
evid suspect him of play some wretch fraud upon them and
seem half inclin to scalp the parti but final they dismiss us
with a warn couch in excel greek i suppos and drop
tranquilli in our wake when they had gone three hundr yard they
stop and we went on rejoic but behold anoth arm rascal came
out of the shadow and took their place and follow us two hundr
yard then he deliv us over to anoth miscreant who emerg from
some mysteri place and he in turn to anoth for a mile and a half
our rear was guard all the while by arm men i never travel in so
much state befor in all my life

it was a good while after that befor we ventur to steal ani more
grape and when we did we stir up anoth troublesom brigand and
then we ceas all further specul in that line i suppos that
fellow that rode by on the mule post all the sentinel from athen to
the piraeus about us

everi field on that long rout was watch by an arm sentinel some of
whom had fallen asleep no doubt but were on hand nevertheless this
show what sort of a countri modern attica isa communiti of
question charact these men were not there to guard their
possess against stranger but against each other for stranger
seldom visit athen and the piraeus and when they do they go in
daylight and can buy all the grape they want for a trifl the modern
inhabit are confisc and falsifi of high reput if gossip
speak truli concern them and i freeli believ it doe

just as the earliest ting of the dawn flush the eastern sky and
turn the pillar parthenon to a broken harp hung in the pear
horizon we close our thirteenth mile of weari roundabout march
and emerg upon the seashor abreast the ship with our usual escort
of fifteen hundr piraean dog howl at our heel we hail a boat
that was two or three hundr yard from shore and discov
in a moment that it was a policeboat on the lookout for ani
quarantinebreak that might chanc to be abroad so we dodgedw
were use to that by this timeand when the scout reach the spot we
had so late occupi we were absent they cruis along the shore
but in the wrong direct and short our own boat issu from the
gloom and took us aboard they had heard our signal on the ship we
row noiseless away and befor the policeboat came in sight again
we were safe at home onc more

four more of our passeng were anxious to visit athen and start
half an hour after we return but they had not been ashor five minut
till the polic discov and chase them so hot that they bare
escap to their boat again and that was all they pursu the
enterpris no further

we set sail for constantinopl today but some of us littl care for
that we have seen all there was to see in the old citi that had it
birth sixteen hundr year befor christ was born and was an old town
befor the foundat of troy were laidand saw it in it most
attract aspect wherefor whi should we worri

two other passeng ran the blockad success last night so we
learn this morn they slip away so quiet that they were not
miss from the ship for sever hour they had the hardihood to march
into the piraeus in the earli dusk and hire a carriag they ran some
danger of ad two or three month imprison to the other novelti
of their holi land pleasur excurs i admir cheek quotat
from the pilgrim but they went and came safe and never walk a
step




chapter xxxiii

from athen all through the island of the grecian archipelago we saw
littl but forbid seawal and barren hill sometim surmount by
three or four grace column of some ancient templ lone and
deserteda fit symbol of the desol that has come upon all
greec in these latter age we saw no plough field veri few
villag no tree or grass or veget of ani kind scarc and
hard ever an isol hous greec is a bleak unsmil desert
without agricultur manufactur or commerc appar what support
it povertystricken peopl or it govern is a mysteri

i suppos that ancient greec and modern greec compar furnish the
most extravag contrast to be found in histori georg i an infant
of eighteen and a scraggi nest of foreign offic holder sit in the
place of themistocl pericl and the illustri scholar and
general of the golden age of greec the fleet that were the wonder of
the world when the parthenon was new are a beggar hand of
fishingsmack now and the man peopl that perform such miracl of
valor at marathon are onli a tribe of unconsid slave today the
classic illyssus has gone dri and so have all the sourc of grecian
wealth and great the nation number onli eight hundr thousand
soul and there is poverti and miseri and mendac enough among them
to furnish forti million and be liber about it under king otho the
revenu of the state were five million of dollarsrais from a tax
of onetenth of all the agricultur product of the land which tenth
the farmer had to bring to the royal granari on packmul ani
distanc not exceed six leagu and from extravag tax on trade
and commerc out of that five million the small tyrant tri to keep
an armi of ten thousand men pay all the hundr of useless grand
equerri in wait first groom of the bedchamb lord high
chancellor of the explod exchequ and all the other absurd
which these puppykingdom indulg in in imit of the great
monarchi and in addit he set about build a white marbl palac
to cost about five million itself the result was simpli ten into
five goe no time and none over all these thing could not be done
with five million and otho fell into troubl

the greek throne with it unpromis adjunct of a rag popul of
ingeni rascal who were out of employ eight month in the year
becaus there was littl for them to borrow and less to confisc and a
wast of barren hill and weedgrown desert went beg for a good
while it was offer to one of victoria son and afterward to
various other younger son of royalti who had no throne and were out of
busi but they all had the chariti to declin the dreari honor and
vener enough for greec ancient great to refus to mock her
sorrow rag and dirt with a tinsel throne in this day of her
humiliationtil they came to this young danish georg and he took it
he has finish the splendid palac i saw in the radiant moonlight the
other night and is do mani other thing for the salvat of greec
they say

we sail through the barren archipelago and into the narrow channel
they sometim call the dardanell and sometim the hellespont this
part of the countri is rich in histor reminisc and poor as sahara
in everi thing els for instanc as we approach the dardanell we
coast along the plain of troy and past the mouth of the scamand we
saw where troy had stood in the distanc and where it doe not stand
nowa citi that perish when the world was young the poor trojan are
all dead now they were born too late to see noah ark and die too
soon to see our menageri we saw where agamemnon fleet rendezv
and away inland a mountain which the map said was mount ida within the
hellespont we saw where the origin first shoddi contract mention in
histori was carri out and the parti of the second part gentl
rebuk by xerx i speak of the famous bridg of boat which xerx
order to be built over the narrowest part of the hellespont where it
is onli two or three mile wide a moder gale destroy the flimsi
structur and the king think that to public rebuk the contractor
might have a good effect on the next set call them out befor the armi
and had them behead in the next ten minut he let a new contract for
the bridg it has been observ by ancient writer that the second
bridg was a veri good bridg xerx cross his host of five million

probabl have been there yet if our govern would rebuk some of our
shoddi contractor occasion it might work much good in the
hellespont we saw where leander and lord byron swam across the one to
see her upon whom his soul affect were fix with a devot that
onli death could impair and the other mere for a flyer as jack say
we had two note tomb near us too on one shore slept ajax and on the
other hecuba

we had water batteri and fort on both side of the hellespont fli
the crimson flag of turkey with it white crescent and occasion a
villag and sometim a train of camel we had all these to look at
till we enter the broad sea of marmora and then the land soon fade
from view we resum euchr and whist onc more

we drop anchor in the mouth of the golden horn at daylight in the
morn onli three or four of us were up to see the great ottoman
capit the passeng do not turn out at unseason hour as they
use to to get the earliest possibl glimps of strang foreign citi
they are well over that if we were lie in sight of the pyramid of
egypt they would not come on deck until after breakfast nowaday

the golden horn is a narrow arm of the sea which branch from the
bosporus a sort of broad river which connect the marmora and black
sea and curv around divid the citi in the middl galata and
pera are on one side of the bosporus and the golden horn stamboul
ancient byzantium is upon the other on the other bank of the bosporus
is scutari and other suburb of constantinopl this great citi contain
a million inhabit but so narrow are it street and so crowd
togeth are it hous that it doe not cover much more than half as
much ground as new york citi seen from the anchorag or from a mile or
so up the bosporus it is by far the handsomest citi we have seen it
dens array of hous swell upward from the water edg and spread
over the dome of mani hill and the garden that peep out here and
there the great globe of the mosqu and the countless minaret that
meet the eye everi where invest the metropoli with the quaint orient
aspect one dream of when he read book of eastern travel
constantinopl make a nobl pictur

but it attract begin and end with it picturesqu from
the time one start ashor till he get back again he execr it the
boat he goe in is admir miscalcul for the servic it is built
for it is handsom and neat fit up but no man could handl it
well in the turbul current that sweep down the bosporus from the
black sea and few men could row it satisfactorili even in still water
it is a long light cano caiqu larg at one end and taper to a
knife blade at the other they make that long sharp end the bow and you
can imagin how these boil current spin it about it has two oar
and sometim four and no rudder you start to go to a given point and
you run in fifti differ direct befor you get there first one
oar is back water and then the other it is seldom that both are
go ahead at onc this kind of boat is calcul to drive an
impati man mad in a week the boatmen are the awkwardest the
stupidest and the most unscientif on earth without question

ashor it waswel it was an etern circus peopl were thicker than
bee in those narrow street and the men were dress in all the
outrag outlandish idolatr extravag thunderandlightn
costum that ever a tailor with the delirium tremen and seven devil

and then there was the gooseranchera fellow who drove a hundr gees
befor him about the citi and tri to sell them he had a pole ten
feet long with a crook in the end of it and occasion a goos would
branch out from the flock and make a live break around the corner with

squat around him or dodg out of the way of ass and men we
came by again within the hour and he was take account of stock to
see whether ani of his flock had stray or been stolen the way he did
it was uniqu he put the end of his stick within six or eight inch of

if you want dwarfsi mean just a few dwarf for a curiositygo to
genoa if you wish to buy them by the gross for retail go to milan
there are plenti of dwarf all over itali but it did seem to me that in
milan the crop was luxuri if you would see a fair averag style of
assort crippl go to napl or travel through the roman state
but if you would see the veri heart and home of crippl and human
monster both go straight to constantinopl a beggar in napl who
can show a foot which has all run into one horribl toe with one
shapeless nail on it has a fortunebut such an exhibit as that would
not provok ani notic in constantinopl the man would starv who
would pay ani attent to attract like his among the rare monster
that throng the bridg of the golden horn and display their deform
in the gutter of stamboul o wretch impostor how could he stand
against the threeleg woman and the man with his eye in his cheek
how would he blush in presenc of the man with finger on his elbow
where would he hide himself when the dwarf with seven finger on each
hand no upper lip and his underjaw gone came down in his majesti
bismillah the crippl of europ are a delus and a fraud the truli
gift flourish onli in the byway of pera and stamboul

that threeleg woman lay on the bridg with her stock in trade so
dispos as to command the most strike effecton natur leg and two
long slender twist one with feet on them like somebodi els
forearm then there was a man further along who had no eye and whose
face was the color of a flyblown beefsteak and wrinkl and twist
like a lavaflowand verili so tumbl and distort were his featur
that no man could tell the wart that serv him for a nose from his
cheekbon in stamboul was a man with a prodigi head an uncommon
long bodi leg eight inch long and feet like snowsho he travel
on those feet and his hand and was as swayback as if the colossus
of rhode had been ride him ah a beggar has to have exceed
good point to make a live in constantinopl a bluefac man who
had noth to offer except that he had been blown up in a mine would
be regard as a rank impostor and a mere damag soldier on crutch
would never make a cent it would pay him to get apiec of his head
taken off and cultiv a wen like a carpet sack

the mosqu of st sophia is the chief lion of constantinopl you must
get a firman and hurri there the first thing we did that we did not
get a firman but we took along four or five franc apiec which is much
the same thing

i do not think much of the mosqu of st sophia i suppos i lack
appreci we will let it go at that it is the rustiest old barn in
heathendom i believ all the interest that attach to it come from
the fact that it was built for a christian church and then turn into a
mosqu without much alter by the mohammedan conqueror of the
land they made me take off my boot and walk into the place in my
stockingfeet i caught cold and got myself so stuck up with a
complic of gum slime and general corrupt that i wore out more
than two thousand pair of bootjack get my boot off that night and
even then some christian hide peel off with them i abat not a singl
bootjack

st sophia is a coloss church thirteen or fourteen hundr year old
and unsight enough to be veri veri much older it immens dome is
said to be more wonder than st peter but it dirt is much more
wonder than it dome though they never mention it the church has a
hundr and seventi pillar in it each a singl piec and all of cost
marbl of various kind but they came from ancient templ at baalbec
heliopoli athen and ephesus and are batter ugli and repuls
they were a thousand year old when this church was new and then the
contrast must have been ghastlyif justinian architect did not trim
them ani the insid of the dome is figur all over with a monstrous
inscript in turkish charact wrought in gold mosaic that look as
glare as a circus bill the pavement and the marbl balustrad are
all batter and dirti the perspect is mar everi where by a web of
rope that depend from the dizzi height of the dome and suspend
countless dingi coars oil lamp and ostrichegg six or seven feet
abov the floor squat and sit in group here and there and far
and near were rag turk read book hear sermon or receiv
lesson like children and in fifti place were more of the same sort
bow and straighten up bow again and get down to kiss the
earth mutter prayer the while and keep up their gymnast till
they ought to have been tire if they were not

everi where was dirt and dust and dingi and gloom everi where
were sign of a hoari antiqu but with noth touch or beauti
about it everi where were those group of fantast pagan overhead the
gaudi mosaic and the web of lampropesnowher was there ani thing to
win one love or challeng his admir

the peopl who go into ecstasi over st sophia must sure get them out
of the guidebook where everi church is spoken of as be consid
by good judg to be the most marvel structur in mani respect that
the world has ever seen  or els they are those old connoisseur from
the wild of new jersey who labori learn the differ between a
fresco and a fireplug and from that day forward feel privileg to void
their critic batho on paint sculptur and architectur forev

we visit the danc dervish there were twentyon of them they
wore a long lightcolor loos robe that hung to their heel each in
his turn went up to the priest they were all within a larg circular
rail and bow profound and then went spin away deliri and
took his appoint place in the circl and continu to spin when all
had spun themselv to their place they were about five or six feet
apartand so situat the entir circl of spin pagan spun itself
three separ time around the room it took twentyf minut to do
it they spun on the left foot and kept themselv go by pass the
right rapid befor it and dig it against the wax floor some of
them made incred time  most of them spun around forti time in a
minut and one artist averag about sixtyon time a minut and kept
it up dure the whole twentyf his robe fill with air and stood
out all around him like a balloon

they made no nois of ani kind and most of them tilt their head back
and close their eye entranc with a sort of devot ecstaci
there was a rude kind of music part of the time but the musician were
not visibl none but spinner were allow within the circl a man
had to either spin or stay outsid it was about as barbar an
exhibit as we have wit yet then sick person came and lay
down and besid them women laid their sick children one a babe at the
breast and the patriarch of the dervish walk upon their bodi he
was suppos to cure their diseas by trampl upon their breast or
back or stand on the back of their neck this is well enough for a
peopl who think all their affair are made or mar by viewless spirit
of the airbi giant gnome and geniiand who still believ to this
day all the wild tale in the arabian night even so an intellig
missionari tell me

we visit the thousand and one column i do not know what it was
origin intend for but they said it was built for a reservoir it
is situat in the centr of constantinopl you go down a flight of
stone step in the middl of a barren place and there you are you are
forti feet under ground and in the midst of a perfect wilder of
tall slender granit column of byzantin architectur stand where
you would or chang your posit as often as you pleas you were
alway a centr from which radiat a dozen long archway and colonnad
that lost themselv in distanc and the sombr twilight of the place
this old driedup reservoir is occupi by a few ghost silkspinn
now and one of them show me a cross cut high up in one of the pillar
i suppos he meant me to understand that the institut was there befor
the turkish occup and i thought he made a remark to that effect
but he must have had an impedi in his speech for i did not
understand him

we took off our shoe and went into the marbl mausoleum of the sultan
mahmoud the neatest piec of architectur insid that i have seen
late mahmoud tomb was cover with a black velvet pall which was
elabor embroid with silver it stood within a fanci silver
rail at the side and corner were silver candlestick that would
weigh more than a hundr pound and they support candl as larg as
a man leg on the top of the sarcophagus was a fez with a handsom
diamond ornament upon it which an attend said cost a hundr thousand
pound and lie like a turk when he said it mahmoud whole famili
were comfort plant around him

we went to the great bazaar in stamboul of cours and i shall not
describ it further than to say it is a monstrous hive of littl shop
thousand i should sayal under one roof and cut up into innumer
littl block by narrow street which are arch overhead one street is
devot to a particular kind of merchandis anoth to anoth and so
on

when you wish to buy a pair of shoe you have the swing of the whole
streetyou do not have to walk yourself down hunt store in differ
local it is the same with silk antiqu shawl etc the
place is crowd with peopl all the time and as the gaycolor eastern
fabric are lavish display befor everi shop the great bazaar of
stamboul is one of the sight that are worth see it is full of life
and stir and busi dirt beggar ass yell peddler porter
dervish highborn turkish femal shopper greek and weirdlook
and weird dress mohammedan from the mountain and the far provinc
and the onli solitari thing one doe not smell when he is in the great
bazaar is someth which smell good




chapter xxxiv

mosqu are plenti church are plenti graveyard are plenti but
moral and whiskey are scarc the koran doe not permit mohammedan to
drink their natur instinct do not permit them to be moral they say
the sultan has eight hundr wive this almost amount to bigami it
make our cheek burn with shame to see such a thing permit here in
turkey we do not mind it so much in salt lake howev

circassian and georgian girl are still sold in constantinopl by their
parent but not public the great slave mart we have all read so
much aboutwher tender young girl were strip for inspect and
criticis and discuss just as if they were hors at an agricultur
fairno longer exist the exhibit and the sale are privat now
stock are up just at present part becaus of a brisk demand creat
by the recent return of the sultan suit from the court of europ
part on account of an unusu abund of breadstuff which leav
holder untortur by hunger and enabl them to hold back for high
price and part becaus buyer are too weak to bear the market while
seller are ampli prepar to bull it under these circumst if the
american metropolitan newspap were publish here in constantinopl
their next commerci report would read about as follow i suppos

which was unusu poor the new crop is a littl backward but
will be come in short as regard it quantiti and qualiti the
account are most encourag in this connect we can safe
say also that the new crop of circassian is look extrem
well his majesti the sultan has alreadi sent in larg order for
his new harem which will be finish within a fortnight and this
has natur strengthen the market and given circassian stock a
strong upward tendenc take advantag of the inflat market
mani of our shrewdest oper are sell short there are hint
of a corner on wallachian

there is noth new in nubian slow sale

eunuchsnon offer howev larg cargo are expect from
egypt today 


i think the abov would be about the style of the commerci report
price are pretti high now and holder firm but two or three year
ago parent in a starv condit brought their young daughter down
here and sold them for even twenti and thirti dollar when they could do
no better simpli to save themselv and the girl from die of want
it is sad to think of so distress a thing as this and i for one am
sincer glad the price are up again

commerci moral especi are bad there is no gainsay that
greek turkish and armenian moral consist onli in attend church
regular on the appoint sabbath and in break the ten command
all the balanc of the week it come natur to them to lie and cheat
in the first place and then they go on and improv on natur until they
arriv at perfect in recommend his son to a merchant as a
valuabl salesman a father doe not say he is a nice moral upright
boy and goe to sunday school and is honest but he say this boy is
worth his weight in broad piec of a hundredfor behold he will cheat
whomsoev hath deal with him and from the euxin to the water of
marmora there abideth not so gift a liar  how is that for a
recommend the missionari tell me that they hear encomium like
that pass upon peopl everi day they say of a person they admir
ah he is a charm swindler and a most exquisit liar 

everi bodi lie and cheatseveri bodi who is in busi at ani rate
even foreign soon have to come down to the custom of the countri and
they do not buy and sell long in constantinopl till they lie and cheat
like a greek i say like a greek becaus the greek are call the
worst transgressor in this line sever american long resid in
constantinopl contend that most turk are pretti trustworthi but few
claim that the greek have ani virtu that a man can discoverat least
without a fire assay

i am half will to believ that the celebr dog of constantinopl
have been misrepresentedsland i have alway been led to suppos
that they were so thick in the street that they block the way that
they move about in organ compani platoon and regiment and took
what they want by determin and feroci assault and that at night
they drown all other sound with their terribl howl the dog i
see here can not be those i have read of

i find them everi where but not in strong forc the most i have found
togeth has been about ten or twenti and night or day a fair
proport of them were sound asleep those that were not asleep alway
look as if they want to be i never saw such utter wretch
starv sadvisag brokenheart look cur in my life it seem
a grim satir to accus such brute as these of take thing by forc of
arm they hard seem to have strength enough or ambit enough to
walk across the streeti do not know that i have seen one walk that far
yet they are mangi and bruis and mutil and often you see one
with the hair sing off him in such wide and well defin tract that he
look like a map of the new territori they are the sorriest beast
that breatheth most abjectth most piti in their face is a
settl express of melancholi an air of hopeless despond the
hairless patch on a scald dog are prefer by the flea of
constantinopl to a wider rang on a healthier dog and the expos
place suit the flea exact i saw a dog of this kind start to nibbl
at a fleaa fli attract his attent and he made a snatch at him
the flea call for him onc more and that forev unsettl him he
look sad at his fleapastur then sad look at his bald spot
then he heav a sigh and drop his head resign upon his paw he
was not equal to the situat

the dog sleep in the street all over the citi from one end of the
street to the other i suppos they will averag about eight or ten to a
block sometim of cours there are fifteen or twenti to a block
they do not belong to ani bodi and they seem to have no close person
friendship among each other but they district the citi themselv and
the dog of each district whether it be half a block in extent or ten
block have to remain within it bound woe to a dog if he cross the
line his neighbor would snatch the balanc of his hair off in a
second so it is said but they dont look it

they sleep in the street these day they are my compassmi guid
when i see the dog sleep placid on while men sheep gees and all
move thing turn out and go around them i know i am not in the great
street where the hotel is and must go further in the grand rue the
dog have a sort of air of be on the lookoutan air born of be
oblig to get out of the way of mani carriag everi dayand that
express one recogn in a moment it doe not exist upon the face
of ani dog without the confin of that street all other sleep
placid and keep no watch they would not move though the sultan
himself pass by

in one narrow street but none of them are wide i saw three dog lie
coil up about a foot or two apart end to end they lay and so they
just bridg the street neat from gutter to gutter a drove of a
hundr sheep came along they step right over the dog the rear
crowd the front impati to get on the dog look lazili up
flinch a littl when the impati feet of the sheep touch their raw
backssigh and lay peac down again no talk could be plainer
than that so some of the sheep jump over them and other scrambl
between occasion chip a leg with their sharp hoof and when the
whole flock had made the trip the dog sneez a littl in the cloud of
dust but never budg their bodi an inch i thought i was lazi but i
am a steamengin compar to a constantinopl dog but was not that a
singular scene for a citi of a million inhabit

these dog are the scaveng of the citi that is their offici
posit and a hard one it is howev it is their protect but
for their use in partial cleans these terribl street they
would not be toler long they eat ani thing and everi thing that
come in their way from melon rind and spoil grape up through all
the grade and speci of dirt and refus to their own dead friend and
relativesand yet they are alway lean alway hungri alway
despond the peopl are loath to kill themdo not kill them in
fact the turk have an innat antipathi to take the life of ani dumb
anim it is said but they do wors they hang and kick and stone and
scald these wretch creatur to the veri verg of death and then leav
them to live and suffer

onc a sultan propos to kill off all the dog here and did begin the
workbut the populac rais such a howl of horror about it that the
massacr was stay after a while he propos to remov them all to an
island in the sea of marmora no object was offer and a shipload
or so was taken away but when it came to be known that somehow or other
the dog never got to the island but alway fell overboard in the night
and perish anoth howl was rais and the transport scheme was
drop

so the dog remain in peaceabl possess of the street i do not say
that they do not howl at night nor that they do not attack peopl who
have not a red fez on their head i onli say that it would be mean for
me to accus them of these unseem thing who have not seen them do them
with my own eye or heard them with my own ear

i was a littl surpris to see turk and greek play newsboy right
here in the mysteri land where the giant and genii of the arabian
night onc dweltwher wing hors and hydrahead dragon guard
enchant castleswher princ and princess flew through the air on
carpet that obey a mystic talismanwher citi whose hous were
made of precious stone sprang up in a night under the hand of the
magician and where busi mart were sudden stricken with a spell and
each citizen lay or sat or stood with weapon rais or foot advanc
just as he was speechless and motionless till time had told a hundr
year

it was curious to see newsboy sell paper in so dreami a land as
that and to say truli it is compar a new thing here the
sell of newspap had it birth in constantinopl about a year ago
and was a child of the prussian and austrian war

there is one paper publish here in the english languageth levant
heraldand there are general a number of greek and a few french paper
rise and fall struggl up and fall again newspap are not
popular with the sultan govern they do not understand journal
the proverb say the unknown is alway great  to the court the
newspap is a mysteri and rascal institut they know what a
pestil is becaus they have one occasion that thin the peopl
out at the rate of two thousand a day and they regard a newspap as a
mild form of pestil when it goe astray they suppress itpounc
upon it without warn and throttl it when it dont go astray for a
long time they get suspici and throttl it anyhow becaus they think
it is hatch deviltri imagin the grand vizier in solemn council with
the magnat of the realm spell his way through the hate newspap
and final deliv his profound decis this thing mean mischief
it is too dark too suspici inoffensivesuppress it warn the
publish that we can not have this sort of thing put the editor in
prison 

the newspap busi has it inconveni in constantinopl two
greek paper and one french one were suppress here within a few day of
each other no victori of the cretan are allow to be print from
time to time the grand vizier send a notic to the various editor that
the cretan insurrect is entir suppress and although that editor
know better he still has to print the notic the levant herald is too
fond of speak prais of american to be popular with the sultan
who doe not relish our sympathi with the cretan and therefor that
paper has to be particular circumspect in order to keep out of troubl
onc the editor forget the offici notic in his paper that the
cretan were crush out print a letter of a veri differ tenor
from the american consul in crete and was fine two hundr and fifti
dollar for it short he print anoth from the same sourc and was
imprison three month for his pain i think i could get the assist
editorship of the levant herald but i am go to tri to worri along
without it

to suppress a paper here involv the ruin of the publish almost but
in napl i think they specul on misfortun of that kind paper are
suppress there everi day and spring up the next day under a new name
dure the ten day or a fortnight we staid there one paper was murder
and resurrect twice the newsboy are smart there just as they are
elsewher they take advantag of popular weak when they find
they are not like to sell out they approach a citizen mysteri
and say in a low voicelast copi sir doubl price paper just been
suppress  the man buy it of cours and find noth in it they
do sayi do not vouch for itbut they do say that men sometim print a
vast edit of a paper with a feroci sediti articl in it
distribut it quick among the newsboy and clear out till the
govern indign cool it pay well confisc dont amount
to ani thing the type and press are not worth take care of

there is onli one english newspap in napl it has seventi
subscrib the publish is get rich veri deliberatelyveri

slab of meat from between his teeth with a fork then he use the fork
to turn the egg withand brought them along jack said pass again

ration of sausag the cook got out his wire apport a proper
amount of sausagemeat spat it on his hand and fell to work this
time with one accord we all pass out we paid and left that is
all i learn about turkish lunch a turkish lunch is good no doubt
but it has it littl drawback

when i think how i have been swindl by book of orient travel i want
a tourist for breakfast for year and year i have dream of the
wonder of the turkish bath for year and year i have promis myself
that i would yet enjoy one mani and mani a time in fanci i have lain
in the marbl bath and breath the slumbrous fragranc of eastern
spice that fill the air then pass through a weird and complic
system of pull and haul and drench and scrub by a gang of
nake savag who loom vast and vagu through the steam mist
like demon then rest for a while on a divan fit for a king then
pass through anoth complex ordeal and one more fear than the
first and final swath in soft fabric been convey to a princ
saloon and laid on a bed of eider down where eunuch gorgeous of
costum fan me while i drows and dream or content gaze at
the rich hang of the apart the soft carpet the sumptuous
furnitur the pictur and drank delici coffe smoke the sooth
narghili and drop at the last into tranquil repos lull by
sensuous odor from unseen censer by the gentl influenc of the
narghili persian tobacco and by the music of fountain that
counterfeit the patter of summer rain

that was the pictur just as i got it from incendiari book of travel
it was a poor miser impostur the realiti is no more like it than
the five point are like the garden of eden they receiv me in a great
court pave with marbl slab around it were broad galleri one abov
anoth carpet with seedi mat rail with unpaint balustrad
and furnish with huge ricketi chair cushion with rusti old
mattress indent with impress left by the form of nine
success generat of men who had repos upon them the place was
vast nake dreari it court a barn it galleri stall for human
hors the cadaver half nude varlet that serv in the
establish had noth of poetri in their appear noth of
romanc noth of orient splendor they shed no entranc odor
just the contrari their hungri eye and their lank form continu
suggest one glare unsentiment factthey want what they term in
california a squar meal 

i went into one of the rack and undress an unclean starvel
wrap a gaudi tablecloth about his loin and hung a white rag over my
shoulder if i had had a tub then it would have come natur to me to
take in wash i was then conduct down stair into the wet slipperi
court and the first thing that attract my attent were my heel
my fall excit no comment they expect it no doubt it belong in
the list of soften sensuous influenc peculiar to this home of
eastern luxuri it was soften enough certain but it applic
was not happi they now gave me a pair of wooden clogsbench in
miniatur with leather strap over them to confin my feet which they
would have done onli i do not wear no s these thing dangl
uncomfort by the strap when i lift up my feet and came down in
awkward and unexpect place when i put them on the floor again and
sometim turn sideway and wrench my ankl out of joint howev
it was all orient luxuri and i did what i could to enjoy it

they put me in anoth part of the barn and laid me on a stuffi sort of
pallet which was not made of cloth of gold or persian shawl but was
mere the unpretend sort of thing i have seen in the negro quarter
of arkansa there was noth whatev in this dim marbl prison but
five more of these bier it was a veri solemn place i expect that
the spice odor of arabi were go to steal over my sens now but
they did not a coppercolor skeleton with a rag around him brought
me a glass decant of water with a light tobacco pipe in the top of
it and a pliant stem a yard long with a brass mouthpiec to it

it was the famous narghili of the eastth thing the grand turk smoke
in the pictur this began to look like luxuri i took one blast at
it and it was suffici the smoke went in a great volum down into my
stomach my lung even into the uttermost part of my frame i explod
one mighti cough and it was as if vesuvius had let go for the next
five minut i smoke at everi pore like a frame hous that is on fire
on the insid not ani more narghili for me the smoke had a vile
tast and the tast of a thousand infidel tongu that remain on that
brass mouthpiec was viler still i was get discourag whenev
hereaft i see the crossleg grand turk smoke his narghili in
pretend bliss on the outsid of a paper of connecticut tobacco i
shall know him for the shameless humbug he is

this prison was fill with hot air when i had got warm up
suffici to prepar me for a still warmer temperatur they took me
where it wasinto a marbl room wet slipperi and steami and laid me
out on a rais platform in the centr it was veri warm present my
man sat me down by a tank of hot water drench me well glove his hand
with a coars mitten and began to polish me all over with it i began
to smell disagre the more he polish the wors i smelt it was
alarm i said to him

i perceiv that i am pretti far gone it is plain that i ought to be
buri without ani unnecessari delay perhap you had better go after my
friend at onc becaus the weather is warm and i can not keep long 

he went on scrub and paid no attent i soon saw that he was
reduc my size he bore hard on his mitten and from under it roll
littl cylind like maccaroni it could not be dirt for it was too
white he pare me down in this way for a long time final i said

it is a tedious process it will take hour to trim me to the size you
want me i will wait go and borrow a jackplan 

he paid no attent at all

after a while he brought a basin some soap and someth that seem to
be the tail of a hors he made up a prodigi quantiti of soapsud
delug me with them from head to foot without warn me to shut my
eye and then swab me vicious with the horsetail then he left me
there a snowi statu of lather and went away when i got tire of
wait i went and hunt him up he was prop against the wall in
anoth room asleep i woke him he was not disconcert he took me
back and flood me with hot water then turban my head swath me
with dri tablecloth and conduct me to a lattic chickencoop in one
of the galleri and point to one of those arkansa bed i mount
it and vagu expect the odor of arabi a gain they did not come

the blank unorna coop had noth about it of that orient
voluptu one read of so much it was more suggest of the
counti hospit than ani thing els the skinni servitor brought a
narghili and i got him to take it out again without wast ani time
about it then he brought the worldrenown turkish coffe that poet
have sung so raptur for mani generat and i seiz upon it as
the last hope that was left of my old dream of eastern luxuri it was
anoth fraud of all the unchristian beverag that ever pass my
lip turkish coffe is the worst the cup is small it is smear with
ground the coffe is black thick unsavori of smell and execr in
tast the bottom of the cup has a muddi sediment in it half an inch
deep this goe down your throat and portion of it lodg by the way
and produc a tickl aggrav that keep you bark and cough
for an hour

here endeth my experi of the celebr turkish bath and here also
endeth my dream of the bliss the mortal revel in who pass through it
it is a malign swindl the man who enjoy it is qualifi to enjoy
ani thing that is repuls to sight or sens and he that can invest it
with a charm of poetri is abl to do the same with ani thing els in the
world that is tedious and wretch and dismal and nasti

we have got so far east nowa hundr and fiftyf degre of
longitud from san franciscothat my watch can not keep the hang of
the time ani more it has grown discourag and stop i think it
did a wise thing the differ in time between sebastopol and the
pacif coast is enorm when it is six oclock in the morn here
it is somewher about week befor last in california we are excus
for get a littl tangl as to time these distract and
distress about the time have worri me so much that i was afraid my
mind was so much affect that i never would have ani appreci of
time again but when i notic how handi i was yet about comprehend
when it was dinnertim a bless tranquil settl down upon me and
i am tortur with doubt and fear no more

odessa is about twenti hour run from sebastopol and is the most
norther port in the black sea we came here to get coal princip
the citi has a popul of one hundr and thirtythre thousand and
is grow faster than ani other small citi out of america it is a free
port and is the great grain mart of this particular part of the world
it roadstead is full of ship engin are at work now turn the
open roadstead into a spacious artifici harbor it is to be almost
inclos by massiv stone pier one of which will extend into the sea
over three thousand feet in a straight line

i have not felt so much at home for a long time as i did when i rais
the hill and stood in odessa for the first time it look just like an
american citi fine broad street and straight as well low hous
two or three stori wide neat and free from ani quaint of
architectur ornament locust tree border the sidewalk they
call them acacia a stir businesslook about the street and the
store fast walker a familiar new look about the hous and everi
thing yea and a drive and smother cloud of dust that was so like a
messag from our own dear nativ land that we could hard refrain from
shed a few grate tear and execr in the old timehonor
american way look up the street or down the street this way or that
way we saw onli america there was not one thing to remind us that we
were in russia we walk for some littl distanc revel in this
home vision and then we came upon a church and a hackdriv and
presto the illus vanish the church had a slenderspir dome that
round inward at it base and look like a turnip turn upsid down
and the hackman seem to be dress in a long petticoat with out ani
hoop these thing were essenti foreign and so were the carriag
but everi bodi know about these thing and there is no occas for
my describ them

we were onli to stay here a day and a night and take in coal we
consult the guidebook and were rejoic to know that there were no
sight in odessa to see and so we had one good untrammel holyday on
our hand with noth to do but idl about the citi and enjoy
ourselv we saunter through the market and criticis the fear
and wonder costum from the back countri examin the populac as
far as eye could do it and close the entertain with an icecream
debauch we do not get icecream everi where and so when we do we are
apt to dissip to excess we never care ani thing about icecream at
home but we look upon it with a sort of idolatri now that it is so
scarc in these redhot climat of the east

we onli found two piec of statuari and this was anoth bless one
was a bronz imag of the duc de richelieu grandnephew of the splendid
cardin it stood in a spacious handsom promenad overlook the
sea and from it base a vast flight of stone step led down to the
harbortwo hundr of them fifti feet long and a wide land at the
bottom of everi twenti it is a nobl staircas and from a distanc the
peopl toil up it look like insect i mention this statu and this
stairway becaus they have their stori richelieu found odessa
watch over it with patern carelabor with a fertil brain and a
wise understand for it best interestssp his fortun freeli to
the same endendow it with a sound prosper and one which will yet
make it one of the great citi of the old worldbuilt this nobl
stairway with money from his own privat purseand well the peopl
for whom he had done so much let him walk down these same step one
day unattend old poor without a second coat to his back and when
year afterward he die in sebastopol in poverti and neglect they
call a meet subscrib liber and immedi erect this
tast monument to his memori and name a great street after him
it remind me of what robert burn mother said when they erect a
state monument to his memori ah robbi ye ask them for bread and
they hae gien ye a stane 

the peopl of odessa have warm recommend us to go and call on the
emperor as did the sebastopolian they have telegraph his majesti
and he has signifi his willing to grant us an audienc so we are
get up the anchor and prepar to sail to his wateringplac what
a scratch around there will be now what a hold of import
meet and appoint of solemn committe and what a furbish up
of clawhamm coat and white silk neckti as this fear ordeal we
are about to pass through pictur itself to my fanci in all it dread
sublim i begin to feel my fierc desir to convers with a genuin

chapter xxxvii

we anchor here at yalta russia two or three day ago to me the
place was a vision of the sierra the tall gray mountain that back
it their side bristl with pinescloven with ravinesher and there
a hoari rock tower into viewlong straight streak sweep down
from the summit to the sea mark the passag of some avalanch of
former timesal these were as like what one see in the sierra as if
the one were a portrait of the other the littl villag of yalta
nestl at the foot of an amphitheatr which slope backward and upward
to the wall of hill and look as if it might have sunk quiet down to
it present posit from a higher elev this depress is cover
with the great park and garden of noblemen and through the mass of
green foliag the bright color of their palac bud out here and there
like flower it is a beauti spot

we had the unit state consul on boardth odessa consul we
assembl in the cabin and command him to tell us what we must do to be
save and tell us quick he made a speech the first thing he said
fell like a blight on everi hope spirit he had never seen a court
recept three groan for the consul but he said he had seen
recept at the governor general in odessa and had often listen to
peopl experi of recept at the russian and other court and
believ he knew veri well what sort of ordeal we were about to essay
hope bud again he said we were mani the summer palac was small
a mere mansion doubtless we should be receiv in summer fashionin the
garden we would stand in a row all the gentlemen in swallowtail coat
white kid and white neckti and the ladi in lightcolor silk
or someth of that kind at the proper moment meridianth
emperor attend by his suit array in splendid uniform would appear
and walk slowli along the line bow to some and say two or three
word to other at the moment his majesti appear a univers
delight enthusiast smile ought to break out like a rash among the
passengersa smile of love of gratif of admirationand with
one accord the parti must begin to bownot obsequi but
respect and with digniti at the end of fifteen minut the emperor
would go in the hous and we could run along home again we felt
immens reliev it seem in a manner easi there was not a man
in the parti but believ that with a littl practic he could stand in a
row especi if there were other along there was not a man but
believ he could bow without trip on his coat tail and break his
neck in a word we came to believ we were equal to ani item in the
perform except that complic smile the consul also said we ought
to draft a littl address to the emperor and present it to one of his
aidesdecamp who would forward it to him at the proper time
therefor five gentlemen were appoint to prepar the document and the
fifti other went sad smile about the shippract dure the
next twelv hour we had the general appear somehow of be at a
funer where everi bodi was sorri the death had occur but glad it
was overwher everi bodi was smile and yet brokenheart

a committe went ashor to wait on his excel the governorgener
and learn our fate at the end of three hour of bode suspens they
came back and said the emperor would receiv us at noon the next day
would send carriag for uswould hear the address in person the grand
duke michael had sent to invit us to his palac also ani man could see
that there was an intent here to show that russia friendship for
america was so genuin as to render even her privat citizen object
worthi of kind attent

at the appoint hour we drove out three mile and assembl in the
handsom garden in front of the emperor palac

we form a circl under the tree befor the door for there was no one
room in the hous abl to accommod our threescor person
comfort and in a few minut the imperi famili came out bow and
smile and stood in our midst a number of great dignitari of the
empir in undress unit form came with them with everi bow his
majesti said a word of welcom i copi these speech there is
charact in themrussian characterwhich is polit itself and the
genuin articl the french are polit but it is often mere ceremoni
polit a russian imbu his polit thing with a hearti both
of phrase and express that compel belief in their sincer as i
was say the czar punctuat his speech with bow

good morningi am glad to see youi am gratifiedi am delightedi am
happi to receiv you 

all took off their hat and the consul inflict the address on him he
bore it with unflinch fortitud then took the rustylook document
and hand it to some great offic or other to be file away among the
archiv of russiain the stove he thank us for the address and
said he was veri much pleas to see us especi as such friend
relat exist between russia and the unit state the empress said
the american were favorit in russia and she hope the russian were
similar regard in america these were all the speech that were
made and i recommend them to parti who present policemen with gold
watch as model of breviti and point after this the empress went and
talk sociabl for an empress with various ladi around the circl
sever gentlemen enter into a disjoint general convers with the
emperor the duke and princ admir and maid of honor drop into
freeandeasi chat with first one and then anoth of our parti and
whoever chose step forward and spoke with the modest littl grand
duchess mari the czar daughter she is fourteen year old
lighthair blueey unassum and pretti everi bodi talk
english

the emperor wore a cap frock coat and pantaloon all of some kind of
plain white drillingcotton or linen and sport no jewelri or ani
insignia whatev of rank no costum could be less ostentati he is
veri tall and spare and a determinedlook man though a veri
pleasantlook one nevertheless it is easi to see that he is kind and
affection there is someth veri nobl in his express when his cap
is off there is none of that cun in his eye that all of us notic
in loui napoleon

the empress and the littl grand duchess wore simpl suit of foulard
or foulard silk i dont know which is proper with a small blue spot
in it the dress were trim with blue both ladi wore broad blue
sash about their waist linen collar and cleric tie of muslin
lowcrown strawhat trim with blue velvet parasol and
fleshcolor glove the grand duchess had no heel on her shoe i
do not know this of my own knowledg but one of our ladi told me so
i was not look at her shoe i was glad to observ that she wore her
own hair plait in thick braid against the back of her head instead
of the uncom thing they call a waterfal which is about as much like
a waterfal as a canvascov ham is like a cataract take the kind
express that is in the emperor face and the gentl that is in
his young daughter into consider i wonder if it would not tax
the czar firm to the utmost to condemn a supplic wretch to
miseri in the wast of siberia if she plead for him everi time
their eye met i saw more and more what a tremend power that weak
diffid schoolgirl could wield if she chose to do it mani and mani
a time she might rule the autocrat of russia whose lightest word is law
to seventi million of human be she was onli a girl and she
look like a thousand other i have seen but never a girl provok
such a novel and peculiar interest in me befor a strang new
sensat is a rare thing in this humdrum life and i had it here
there was noth stale or worn out about the thought and feel the
situat and the circumst creat it seem strangestrang
than i can tellto think that the central figur in the cluster of men
and women chat here under the tree like the most ordinari
individu in the land was a man who could open his lip and ship
would fli through the wave locomot would speed over the plain
courier would hurri from villag to villag a hundr telegraph would
flash the word to the four corner of an empir that stretch it vast
proport over a seventh part of the habit globe and a countless
multitud of men would spring to do his bid i had a sort of vagu
desir to examin his hand and see if they were of flesh and blood
like other men here was a man who could do this wonder thing and
yet if i chose i could knock him down the case was plain but it
seem preposter neverthelessa preposter as tri to knock
down a mountain or wipe out a contin if this man sprain his
ankl a million mile of telegraph would carri the news over mountain
valleysuninhabit desertsund the trackless seaand ten thousand
newspap would prate of it if he were grievous ill all the nation
would know it befor the sun rose again if he drop lifeless where he
stood his fall might shake the throne of half a world if i could
have stolen his coat i would have done it when i meet a man like
that i want someth to rememb him by

as a general thing we have been shown through palac by some
plushleg filagre flunkey or other who charg a franc for it but
after talk with the compani half an hour the emperor of russia and
his famili conduct us all through their mansion themselv they made
no charg they seem to take a real pleasur in it

we spent half an hour idl through the palac admir the cosi
apart and the rich but emin homelik appoint of the
place and then the imperi famili bade our parti a kind goodby and
proceed to count the spoon

an invit was extend to us to visit the palac of the eldest son
the crown princ of russia which was near at hand the young man was
absent but the duke and countess and princ went over the premis
with us as leisur as was the case at the emperor and convers
continu as live as ever

it was a littl after one oclock now we drove to the grand duke
michael a mile away in respons to his invit previous given

we arriv in twenti minut from the emperor it is a love place
the beauti palac nestl among the grand old grove of the park the
park sit in the lap of the picturesqu crag and hill and both look
out upon the breezi ocean in the park are rustic seat here and there
in seclud nook that are dark with shade there are rivulet of crystal
water there are lakelet with invit grassi bank there are
glimps of sparkl cascad through open in the wilder of
foliag there are stream of clear water gush from mimic knot on the
trunk of forest tree there are miniatur marbl templ perch upon
gray old crag there are airi lookout whenc one may gaze upon a broad
expans of landscap and ocean the palac is model after the choicest
form of grecian architectur and it wide colonnad surround a central
court that is bank with rare flower that fill the place with their
fragranc and in their midst spring a fountain that cool the summer
air and may possibl breed mosquito but i do not think it doe

the grand duke and his duchess came out and the present ceremoni
were as simpl as they had been at the emperor in a few minut
convers was under way as befor the empress appear in the
verandah and the littl grand duchess came out into the crowd they had
beaten us there in a few minut the emperor came himself on
horseback it was veri pleasant you can appreci it if you have ever
visit royalti and felt occasion that possibl you might be wear
out your welcomethough as a general thing i believ royalti is not
scrupul about discharg you when it is done with you

the grand duke is the third brother of the emperor is about thirtyseven
year old perhap and is the princeliest figur in russia he is even
taller than the czar as straight as an indian and bear himself like
one of those gorgeous knight we read about in romanc of the crusad
he look like a greatheart fellow who would pitch an enemi into the
river in a moment and then jump in and risk his life fish him out
again the stori they tell of him show him to be of a brave and
generous natur he must have been desir of prove that american
were welcom guest in the imperi palac of russia becaus he rode
all the way to yalta and escort our process to the emperor
himself and kept his aid scurri about clear the road and
offer assist wherev it could be need we were rather familiar
with him then becaus we did not know who he was we recogn him
now and appreci the friend spirit that prompt him to do us a
favor that ani other grand duke in the world would have doubtless
declin to do he had plenti of servitor whom he could have sent but
he chose to attend to the matter himself

the grand duke was dress in the handsom and showi uniform of a cossack
offic the grand duchess had on a white alpaca robe with the seam
and gore trim with black barb lace and a littl gray hat with a
feather of the same color she is young rather pretti modest and
unpretend and full of win polit

our parti walk all through the hous and then the nobil escort
them all over the ground and final brought them back to the palac
about halfpast two oclock to breakfast they call it breakfast but
we would have call it luncheon it consist of two kind of wine
tea bread chees and cold meat and was serv on the centret
in the recept room and the verandahsanywher that was conveni
there was no ceremoni it was a sort of picnic i had heard befor that
we were to breakfast there but blucher said he believ baker boy had
suggest it to his imperi high i think notthough it would be
like him baker boy is the faminebreed of the ship he is alway
hungri they say he goe about the stateroom when the passeng are
out and eat up all the soap and they say he eat oakum they say he
will eat ani thing he can get between meal but he prefer oakum he
doe not like oakum for dinner but he like it for a lunch at odd
hour or ani thing that way it make him veri disagre becaus it
make his breath bad and keep his teeth all stuck up with tar baker
boy may have suggest the breakfast but i hope he did not it went off
well anyhow the illustri host move about from place to place and
help to destroy the provis and keep the convers live and
the grand duchess talk with the verandah parti and such as had
satisfi their appetit and straggl out from the recept room

the grand duke tea was delici they give one a lemon to squeez
into it or ice milk if he prefer it the former is best this tea
is brought overland from china it injur the articl to transport it
by sea

when it was time to go we bade our distinguish host goodby and
they retir happi and content to their apart to count their
spoon

we had spent the best part of half a day in the home of royalti and had
been as cheer and comfort all the time as we could have been in
the ship i would as soon have thought of be cheer in abraham
bosom as in the palac of an emperor i suppos that emperor were
terribl peopl i thought they never did ani thing but wear magnific
crown and red velvet dressinggown with dab of wool sew on them in
spot and sit on throne and scowl at the flunki and the peopl in the
parquett and order duke and duchess off to execut i find
howev that when one is so fortun as to get behind the scene and
see them at home and in the privaci of their firesid they are
strang like common mortal they are pleasant to look upon then
than they are in their theatric aspect it seem to come as natur to
them to dress and act like other peopl as it is to put a friend cedar
pencil in your pocket when you are done use it but i can never have
ani confid in the tinsel king of the theatr after this it will be
a great loss i use to take such a thrill pleasur in them but
hereaft i will turn me sad away and say

this doe not answerthi isnt the style of king that i am acquaint
with 

when they swagger around the stage in jewel crown and splendid robe
i shall feel bound to observ that all the emperor that ever i was
person acquaint with wore the commonest sort of cloth and did
not swagger and when they come on the stage attend by a vast
bodyguard of supe in helmet and tin breastplat it will be my duti
as well as my pleasur to inform the ignor that no crown head of my
acquaint has a soldier ani where about his hous or his person

possibl it may be thought that our parti tarri too long or did other
improp thing but such was not the case the compani felt that they
were occupi an unusu respons positionthey were repres
the peopl of america not the governmentand therefor they were
care to do their best to perform their high mission with credit

on the other hand the imperi famili no doubt consid that in
entertain us they were more especi entertain the peopl of
america than they could by shower attent on a whole platoon of
minist plenipotentiari and therefor they gave to the event it
fullest signific as an express of good will and friend feel
toward the entir countri we took the kind we receiv as
attent thus direct of cours and not to ourselv as a parti
that we felt a person pride in be receiv as the repres of
a nation we do not deni that we felt a nation pride in the warm
cordial of that recept can not be doubt

our poet has been rigid suppress from the time we let go the anchor
when it was announc that we were go to visit the emperor of russia
the fountain of his great deep were broken up and he rain ineff
bosh for fourandtwenti hour our origin anxieti as to what we were
go to do with ourselv was sudden transform into anxieti about
what we were go to do with our poet the problem was solv at last
two altern were offer himh must either swear a dread oath
that he would not issu a line of his poetri while he was in the czar
dominion or els remain under guard on board the ship until we were
safe at constantinopl again he fought the dilemma long but yield at
last it was a great deliver perhap the savag reader would like
a specimen of his style i do not mean this term to be offens i
onli use it becaus the gentl reader has been use so often that ani
chang from it can not but be refresh

save us and sanctifi us and final then
see good provis we enjoy while we journey to jerusalem
for so man propos which it is most true
and time will wait for none nor for us too 

the sea has been unusu rough all day howev we have had a
live time of it anyhow we have had quit a run of visitor the
governorgener came and we receiv him with a salut of nine gun
he brought his famili with him i observ that carpet were spread
from the pierhead to his carriag for him to walk on though i have
seen him walk there without ani carpet when he was not on busi i
thought may be he had what the accident insur peopl might call an
extrahazard polish policy joke but not abov mediocr on his
boot and wish to protect them but i examin and could not see that
they were black ani better than usual it may have been that he had
forgotten his carpet befor but he did not have it with him anyhow
he was an exceed pleasant old gentleman we all like him
especi blucher when he went away blucher invit him to come
again and fetch his carpet along

princ dolgorouki and a grand admir or two whom we had seen yesterday
at the recept came on board also i was a littl distant with these
parti at first becaus when i have been visit emperor i do not
like to be too familiar with peopl i onli know by reput and whose
moral charact and stand in societi i can not be thorough
acquaint with i judg it best to be a littl offish at first i
said to myself princ and count and grand admir are veri well but
they are not emperor and one can not be too particular about who he
associ with

baron wrangel came also he use to be russian ambassador at
washington i told him i had an uncl who fell down a shaft and broke
himself in two as much as a year befor that that was a falsehood but
then i was not go to let ani man eclips me on surpris adventur
mere for the want of a littl invent the baron is a fine man and
is said to stand high in the emperor confid and esteem

baron ungernsternberg a boister wholesoul old nobleman came
with the rest he is a man of progress and enterprisea repres
man of the age he is the chief director of the railway system of
russiaa sort of railroad king in his line he is make thing move
along in this countri he has travel extens in america he say he
has tri convict labor on his railroad and with perfect success he
say the convict work well and are quiet and peaceabl he observ
that he employ near ten thousand of them now

this appear to be anoth call on my resourc i was equal to the
emerg i said we had eighti thousand convict employ on the
railway in americaal of them under sentenc of death for murder in
the first degre that close him out

we had general todtleben the famous defend of sebastopol dure the
sieg and mani inferior armi and also navi offic and a number of
unoffici russian ladi and gentlemen natur a champagn luncheon
was in order and was accomplish without loss of life toast and
joke were discharg freeli but no speech were made save one thank
the emperor and the grand duke through the governorgener for our
hospit recept and one by the governorgener in repli in which
he return the emperor thank for the speech etc etc

this seaport of smyrna our first notabl acquaint in asia is a
close pack citi of one hundr and thirti thousand inhabit and
like constantinopl it has no outskirt it is as close pack at it
outer edg as it is in the centr and then the habit leav
sudden off and the plain beyond seem houseless it is just like ani
other orient citi that is to say it moslem hous are heavi and
dark and as comfortless as so mani tomb it street are crook
rude and rough pave and as narrow as an ordinari staircas the

claim the bulk of attent first last and all the timei a
combin of mohammedan stench to which the smell of even a chines
quarter would be as pleasant as the roast odor of the fat calf to
the nostril of the return prodig such is orient luxurysuch is
orient splendor we read about it all our day but we comprehend it
not until we see it smyrna is a veri old citi it name occur sever
time in the bibl one or two of the discipl of christ visit it and
here was locat one of the origin seven apocalypt church spoken of
in revel these church were symbol in the scriptur as
candlestick and on certain condit there was a sort of impli
promis that smyrna should be endow with a crown of life  she was to
be faith unto deaththos were the term she has not kept up her
faith straight along but the pilgrim that wander hither consid that
she has come near enough to it to save her and so they point to the fact
that smyrna today wear her crown of life and is a great citi with a
great commerc and full of energi while the citi wherein were locat
the other six church and to which no crown of life was promis have
vanish from the earth so smyrna realli still possess her crown of
life in a busi point of view her career for eighteen centuri
has been a chequer one and she has been under the rule of princ of
mani creed yet there has been no season dure all that time as far as
we know and dure such season as she was inhabit at all that she
has been without her littl communiti of christian faith unto
death  her was the onli church against which no threat were impli
in the revel and the onli one which surviv

with ephesus forti mile from here where was locat anoth of the
seven church the case was differ the candlestick has been
remov from ephesus her light has been put out pilgrim alway
prone to find propheci in the bibl and often where none exist speak
cheer and complac of poor ruin ephesus as the victim of
propheci and yet there is no sentenc that promis without due
qualif the destruct of the citi the word are

rememb therefor from whenc thou art fallen and repent and
do the first work or els i will come unto thee quick and will
remov thi candlestick out of his place except thou repent 

that is all the other vers are singular complimentari to ephesus
the threat is qualifi there is no histori to show that she did not
repent but the cruelest habit the modern prophecysavan have is that
one of coolli and arbitrarili fit the prophet shirt on to the wrong
man they do it without regard to rhyme or reason both the case i
have just mention are instanc in point those prophecies are
distinct level at the church of ephesus smyrna  etc and yet
the pilgrim invari make them refer to the citi instead no crown
of life is promis to the town of smyrna and it commerc but to the
hand of christian who form it church  if they were faith
unto death  they have their crown nowbut no amount of faith and
legal shrewd combin could legitim drag the citi into a
particip in the promis of the propheci the state languag of
the bibl refer to a crown of life whose lustr will reflect the
daybeam of the endless age of etern not the butterfli exist
of a citi built by men hand which must pass to dust with the
builder and be forgotten even in the mere hand of centuri
vouchsaf to the solid world itself between it cradl and it grave

the fashion of delv out fulfil of propheci where that propheci
consist of mere if  trench upon the absurd suppos a thousand
year from now a malari swamp build itself up in the shallow harbor
of smyrna or someth els kill the town and suppos also that
within that time the swamp that has fill the renown harbor of ephesus
and render her ancient site dead and uninhabit today becom
hard and healthi ground suppos the natur consequ ensu to wit
that smyrna becom a melancholi ruin and ephesus is rebuilt what
would the prophecysavan say they would coolli skip over our age of
the world and say smyrna was not faith unto death and so her crown
of life was deni her ephesus repent and lo her candlestick was
not remov behold these evid how wonder is propheci 

smyrna has been utter destroy six time if her crown of life had
been an insur polici she would have had an opportun to collect on
it the first time she fell but she hold it on suffer and by a
complimentari construct of languag which doe not refer to
her six differ time howev i suppos some infatu
prophecyenthusiast blunder along and said to the infinit disgust of
smyrna and the smyrniot in sooth here is astound fulfil of
propheci smyrna hath not been faith unto death and behold her
crown of life is vanish from her head verili these thing be
astonish 

such thing have a bad influenc they provok world men into use
light convers concern sacr subject thickhead comment
upon the bibl and stupid preacher and teacher work more damag to
religion than sensibl coolbrain clergymen can fight away again toil
as they may it is not good judgment to fit a crown of life upon a citi
which has been destroy six time that other class of wiseacr who
twist propheci in such a manner as to make it promis the destruct and
desol of the same citi use judgment just as bad sinc the citi is
in a veri flourish condit now unhappili for them these thing
put argument into the mouth of infidel

a portion of the citi is pretti exclus turkish the jew have a
quarter to themselv the frank anoth quarter so also with the
armenian the armenian of cours are christian their hous are
larg clean airi handsom pave with black and white squar of
marbl and in the centr of mani of them is a squar court which has in
it a luxuri flowergarden and a sparkl fountain the door of all
the room open on this a veri wide hall lead to the street door and
in this the women sit the most of the day in the cool of the even
they dress up in their best raiment and show themselv at the door
they are all come of counten and exceed neat and clean
they look as if they were just out of a bandbox some of the young
ladiesmani of them i may sayar even veri beauti they averag a
shade better than american girlswhich treason word i pray may be
forgiven me they are veri sociabl and will smile back when a stranger
smile at them bow back when he bow and talk back if he speak to
them no introduct is requir an hour chat at the door with a
pretti girl one never saw befor is easili obtain and is veri
pleasant i have tri it i could not talk anyth but english and
the girl knew noth but greek or armenian or some such barbar
tongu but we got along veri well i find that in case like these the
fact that you can not comprehend each other isnt much of a drawback
in that russia n town of yalta i danc an astonish sort of danc an
hour long and one i had not heard of befor with a veri pretti girl
and we talk incess and laugh exhaust and neither one ever
knew what the other was drive at but it was splendid there were
twenti peopl in the set and the danc was veri live and complic
it was complic enough without mewith me it was more so i threw in
a figur now and then that surpris those russian but i have never
ceas to think of that girl i have written to her but i can not
direct the epistl becaus her name is one of those ninejoint russian
affair and there are not letter enough in our alphabet to hold out
i am not reckless enough to tri to pronounc it when i am awak but i
make a stagger at it in my dream and get up with the lockjaw in the
morn i am fade i do not take my meal now with ani sort of
regular her dear name haunt me still in my dream it is aw on
teeth it never come out of my mouth but it fetch an old snag along
with it and then the lockjaw close down and nip off a coupl of the
last syllablesbut they tast good

come through the dardanell we saw camel train on shore with the

chapter xxxix

we inquir and learn that the lion of smyrna consist of the ruin
of the ancient citadel whose broken and prodigi battlement frown
upon the citi from a lofti hill just in the edg of the townth mount
pagus of scriptur they call it the site of that one of the seven
apocalypt church of asia which was locat here in the first centuri
of the christian era and the grave and the place of martyrdom of the
vener polycarp who suffer in smyrna for his religion some eighteen
hundr year ago

we took littl donkey and start we saw polycarp tomb and then
hurri on

the seven churchesthus they abbrevi itcam next on the list we
rode thereabout a mile and a half in the swelter sunand visit a
littl greek church which they said was built upon the ancient site and
we paid a small fee and the holi attend gave each of us a littl wax
candl as a remembranc of the place and i put mine in my hat and the
sun melt it and the greas all ran down the back of my neck and so now
i have not ani thing left but the wick and it is a sorri and a
wiltedlook wick at that

sever of us argu as well as we could that the church mention in
the bibl meant a parti of christian and not a build that the bibl
spoke of them as be veri poorso poor i thought and so subject to
persecut as per polycarp martyrdom that in the first place they
probabl could not have afford a church edific and in the second
would not have dare to build it in the open light of day if they could
and final that if they had had the privileg of build it common
judgment would have suggest that they build it somewher near the town
but the elder of the ship famili rule us down and scout our
evid howev retribut came to them afterward they found that
they had been led astray and had gone to the wrong place they discov
that the accept site is in the citi

ride through the town we could see mark of the six smyrna that have
exist here and been burn up by fire or knock down by earthquak
the hill and the rock are rent asund in place excav expos
great block of buildingston that have lain buri for age and all
the mean hous and wall of modern smyrna along the way are spot
white with broken pillar capit and fragment of sculptur marbl
that onc adorn the lord palac that were the glori of the citi in
the olden time

the ascent of the hill of the citadel is veri steep and we proceed
rather slowli but there were matter of interest about us in one
place five hundr feet abov the sea the perpendicular bank on the
upper side of the road was ten or fifteen feet high and the cut expos
three vein of oyster shell just as we have seen quartz vein expos
in the cut of a road in nevada or montana the vein were about
eighteen inch thick and two or three feet apart and they slant along
downward for a distanc of thirti feet or more and then disappear
where the cut join the road heaven onli know how far a man might
trace them by strip  they were clean nice oyster shell larg
and just like ani other oyster shell they were thick mass
togeth and none were scatter abov or below the vein each one was
a welldefin lead by itself and without a spur my first instinct was
to set up the usual
notic

we the undersign claim five claim of two hundr feet each
and one for discoveri on this ledg or lode of oystershel
with all it dip spur angl variat and sinuos and
fifti feet on each side of the same to work it etc etc
accord to the mine law of smyrna 

they were such perfect naturallook lead that i could hard keep
from take them up  among the oystershel were mix mani fragment
of ancient broken crockeri ware now how did those mass of
oystershel get there i can not determin broken crockeri and
oystershel are suggest of restaurantsbut then they could have
had no such place away up there on that mountain side in our time
becaus nobodi has live up there a restaur would not pay in such a
stoni forbid desol place and besid there were no champagn
cork among the shell if there ever was a restaur there it must
have been in smyrna palmi day when the hill were cover with
palac i could believ in one restaur on those term but then how
about the three did they have restaur there at three differ
period of the world becaus there are two or three feet of solid
earth between the oyster lead evid the restaur solut will
not answer

the hill might have been the bottom of the sea onc and been lift up
with it oysterb by an earthquakebut then how about the
crockeri and moreov how about three oyster bed one abov anoth
and thick strata of good honest earth between

that theori will not do it is just possibl that this hill is mount
ararat and that noah ark rest here and he ate oyster and threw the
shell overboard but that will not do either there are the three
layer again and the solid earth betweenand besid there were onli
eight in noah famili and they could not have eaten all these oyster
in the two or three month they staid on top of that mountain the
beastshowev it is simpli absurd to suppos he did not know ani more
than to feed the beast on oyster supper

it is painfulit is even humiliatingbut i am reduc at last to one
slender theori that the oyster climb up there of their own accord
but what object could they have had in view what did they want up
there what could ani oyster want to climb a hill for to climb a hill
must necessarili be fatigu and annoy exercis for an oyster the
most natur conclus would be that the oyster climb up there to
look at the sceneri yet when one come to reflect upon the natur of an
oyster it seem plain that he doe not care for sceneri an oyster has
no tast for such thing he care noth for the beauti an oyster
is of a retir disposit and not livelynot even cheer abov the
averag and never enterpris but abov all an oyster doe not take
ani interest in sceneryh scorn it what have i arriv at now
simpli at the point i start from name those oyster shell are
there in regular layer five hundr feet abov the sea and no man
know how they got there i have hunt up the guidebook and the gist
of what they say is this they are there but how they got there is a
mysteri 

twentyf year ago a multitud of peopl in america put on their
ascens robe took a tear leav of their friend and made readi to
fli up into heaven at the first blast of the trumpet but the angel did
not blow it miller resurrect day was a failur the millerit
were disgust i did not suspect that there were miller in asia minor
but a gentleman tell me that they had it all set for the world to come
to an end in smyrna one day about three year ago there was much
buzz and prepar for a long time previous and it culmin in
a wild excit at the appoint time a vast number of the populac
ascend the citadel hill earli in the morn to get out of the way of
the general destruct and mani of the infatu close up their shop
and retir from all earth busi but the strang part of it was
that about three in the afternoon while this gentleman and his friend
were at dinner in the hotel a terrif storm of rain accompani by
thunder and lightn broke forth and continu with dire furi for two
or three hour it was a thing unpreced in smyrna at that time of
the year and scare some of the most skeptic the street ran river
and the hotel floor was flood with water the dinner had to be
suspend when the storm finish and left everi bodi drench through
and through and melancholi and halfdrown the ascensionist came down
from the mountain as dri as so mani charitysermon they had been
look down upon the fear storm go on below and realli believ
that their propos destruct of the world was prove a grand success

a railway here in asiain the dreami realm of the orientin the fabl
land of the arabian nightsi a strang thing to think of and yet they
have one alreadi and are build anoth the present one is well
built and well conduct by an english compani but is not do an
immens amount of busi the first year it carri a good mani
passeng but it freight list onli compris eight hundr pound of
fig

it run almost to the veri gate of ephesusa town great in all age of
the worlda citi familiar to reader of the bibl and one which was as
old as the veri hill when the discipl of christ preach in it
street it date back to the shadowi age of tradit and was the
birthplac of god renown in grecian mytholog the idea of a
locomot tear through such a place as this and wake the phantom
of it old day of romanc out of their dream of dead and gone
centuri is curious enough

we journey thither tomorrow to see the celebr ruin




chapter xl

this has been a stir day the superintend of the railway put a
train at our dispos and did us the further kind of accompani us
to ephesus and give to us his watch care we brought sixti scarc
percept donkey in the freight car for we had much ground to go
over we have seen some of the most grotesqu costum along the line
of the railroad that can be imagin i am glad that no possibl
combin of word could describ them for i might then be foolish
enough to attempt it

at ancient ayassalook in the midst of a forbid desert we came upon
long line of ruin aqueduct and other remnant of architectur
grandeur that told us plain enough we were near what had been a
metropoli onc we left the train and mount the donkey along with
our invit guestspleas young gentlemen from the offic list of
an american manofwar

the littl donkey had saddl upon them which were made veri high in
order that the rider feet might not drag the ground the prevent
did not work well in the case of our tallest pilgrim howev there
were no bridlesnoth but a singl rope tie to the bit it was
pure ornament for the donkey care noth for it if he were
drift to starboard you might put your helm down hard the other way
if it were ani satisfact to you to do it but he would continu to
drift to starboard all the same there was onli one process which could
be depend on and it was to get down and lift his rear around until his
head point in the right direct or take him under your arm and carri
him to a part of the road which he could not get out of without climb
the sun flame down as hot as a furnac and neckscarf veil and
umbrella seem hard ani protect they serv onli to make the long
process look more than ever fantasticfor be it known the ladi were
all ride astrid becaus they could not stay on the shapeless saddl
sidewis the men were perspir and out of temper their feet were
bang against the rock the donkey were caper in everi direct
but the right one and be belabor with club for it and everi now
and then a broad umbrella would sudden go down out of the cavalcad
announc to all that one more pilgrim had bitten the dust it was a
wilder pictur than those solitud had seen for mani a day no donkey
ever exist that were as hard to navig as these i think or that had
so mani vile exasper instinct occasion we grew so tire and
breathless with fight them that we had to desist and immedi the
donkey would come down to a deliber walk this with the fatigu and
the sun would put a man asleep and soon as the man was asleep the
donkey would lie down my donkey shall never see his boyhood home
again he has lain down onc too often he must die

we all stood in the vast theatr of ancient ephesus the stonebench
amphitheatr i meanand had our pictur taken we look as proper
there as we would look ani where i suppos we do not embellish the
general desol of a desert much we add what digniti we can to a
state ruin with our green umbrella and jackass but it is littl
howev we mean well

i wish to say a brief word of the aspect of ephesus

on a high steep hill toward the sea is a gray ruin of ponder block
of marbl wherein tradit say st paul was imprison eighteen
centuri ago from these old wall you have the finest view of the
desol scene where onc stood ephesus the proudest citi of ancient
time and whose templ of diana was so nobl in design and so exquisit
of workmanship that it rank high in the list of the seven wonder of
the world

behind you is the sea in front is a level green valley a marsh in
fact extend far away among the mountain to the right of the front
view is the old citadel of ayassalook on a high hill the ruin mosqu
of the sultan selim stand near it in the plain this is built over the
grave of st john and was former christian church further toward
you is the hill of pion around whose front is cluster all that remain
of the ruin of ephesus that still stand divid from it by a narrow
valley is the long rocki rug mountain of coressus the scene is a
pretti one and yet desolatefor in that wide plain no man can live and
in it is no human habit but for the crumbl arch and monstrous
pier and broken wall that rise from the foot of the hill of pion one
could not believ that in this place onc stood a citi whose renown is
older than tradit itself it is incred to reflect that thing as
familiar all over the world today as household word belong in the
histori and in the shadowi legend of this silent mourn solitud
we speak of apollo and of dianathey were born here of the
metamorphosi of syrinx into a reedit was done here of the great god
panh dwelt in the cave of this hill of coressus of the amazonsthi
was their best prize home of bacchus and hercul both fought the
warlik women here of the cyclopsthey laid the ponder marbl block
of some of the ruin yonder of homerthi was one of his mani
birthplac of cirmon of athen of alcibiad lysand agesilaus
they visit here so did alexand the great so did hannib and
antiochus scipio lucullus and sylla brutus cassius pompey cicero
and augustus antoni was a judg in this place and left his seat in the
open court while the advoc were speak to run after cleopatra
who pass the door from this citi these two sail on pleasur
excurs in galley with silver oar and perfum sail and with
compani of beauti girl to serv them and actor and musician to
amus them in day that seem almost modern so remot are they from the
earli histori of this citi paul the apostl preach the new religion
here and so did john and here it is suppos the former was pit
against wild beast for in  corinthian xv  he say

if after the manner of men i have fought with beast at ephesus 
c

when mani men still live who had seen the christ here mari magdalen
die and here the virgin mari end her day with john albeit rome has
sinc judg it best to locat her grave elsewher six or seven hundr
year agoalmost yesterday as it weretroop of mailclad crusad
throng the street and to come down to trifl we speak of meander
stream and find a new interest in a common word when we discov that
the crook river meander in yonder valley gave it to our dictionari
it make me feel as old as these dreari hill to look down upon these
mosshung ruin this histor desol one may read the scriptur
and believ but he can not go and stand yonder in the ruin theatr and
in imagin peopl it again with the vanish multitud who mob
paul comrad there and shout with one voic great is diana of the
ephesian  the idea of a shout in such a solitud as this almost make
one shudder

it was a wonder citi this ephesus go where you will about these
broad plain you find the most exquisit sculptur marbl fragment
scatter thick among the dust and weed and protrud from the ground
or lie prone upon it are beauti flute column of porphyri and all
precious marbl and at everi step you find eleg carv capit
and massiv base and polish tablet engrav with greek inscript
it is a world of precious relic a wilder of mar and mutil
gem and yet what are these thing to the wonder that lie buri here
under the ground at constantinopl at pisa in the citi of spain
are great mosqu and cathedr whose grandest column came from the
templ and palac of ephesus and yet one has onli to scratch the
ground here to match them we shall never know what magnific is
until this imperi citi is laid bare to the sun

the finest piec of sculptur we have yet seen and the one that impress
us most for we do not know much about art and can not easili work up
ourselv into ecstasi over it is one that lie in this old theatr
of ephesus which st paul riot has made so celebr it is onli the
headless bodi of a man clad in a coat of mail with a medusa head upon
the breastplat but we feel persuad that such digniti and such
majesti were never thrown into a form of stone befor

what builder they were these men of antiqu the massiv arch of
some of these ruin rest upon pier that are fifteen feet squar and
built entir of solid block of marbl some of which are as larg as a
saratoga trunk and some the size of a boardinghous sofa they are not
shell or shaft of stone fill insid with rubbish but the whole pier
is a mass of solid masonri vast arch that may have been the gate of
the citi are built in the same way they have brave the storm and
sieg of three thousand year and have been shaken by mani an
earthquak but still they stand when they dig alongsid of them they
find rang of ponder masonri that are as perfect in everi detail as
they were the day those old cyclopian giant finish them an english
compani is go to excav ephesusand then

and now am i remind of

the legend of the seven sleeper

in the mount of pion yonder is the cave of the seven sleeper onc
upon a time about fifteen hundr year ago seven young men live near
each other in ephesus who belong to the despis sect of the
christian it came to pass that the good king maximilianus i am
tell this stori for nice littl boy and girl it came to pass i
say that the good king maximilianus fell to persecut the christian
and as time roll on he made it veri warm for them so the seven young
men said one to the other let us get up and travel and they got up and
travel they tarri not to bid their father and mother goodby or
ani friend they knew they onli took certain money which their parent
had and garment that belong unto their friend wherebi they might
rememb them when far away and they took also the dog ketmehr which
was the properti of their neighbor malchus becaus the beast did run his
head into a noos which one of the young men was carri careless and
they had not time to releas him and they took also certain chicken
that seem lone in the neighbor coop and likewis some bottl of
curious liquor that stood near the grocer window and then they
depart from the citi byandbi they came to a marvel cave in the
hill of pion and enter into it and feast and present they hurri
on again but they forgot the bottl of curious liquor and left them
behind they travel in mani land and had mani strang adventur
they were virtuous young men and lost no opportun that fell in their
way to make their livelihood their motto was in these word name
procrastin is the thief of time  and so whenev they did come
upon a man who was alon they said behold this person hath the
wherewithallet us go through him and they went through him at the
end of five year they had wax tire of travel and adventur and
long to revisit their old home again and hear the voic and see the
face that were dear unto their youth therefor they went through such
parti as fell in their way where they sojourn at that time and
journey back toward ephesus again for the good king maximilianus was
becom convert unto the new faith and the christian rejoic becaus
they were no longer persecut one day as the sun went down they came
to the cave in the mount of pion and they said each to his fellow let
us sleep here and go and feast and make merri with our friend when the
morn cometh and each of the seven lift up his voic and said it
is a whiz so they went in and lo where they had put them there lay
the bottl of strang liquor and they judg that age had not impair
their excel wherein the wander were right and the head of the
same were level so each of the young men drank six bottl and behold
they felt veri tire then and lay down and slept sound

when they awok one of them johannessurnam smithianussaid we are
nake and it was so their raiment was all gone and the money which
they had gotten from a stranger whom they had proceed through as they
approach the citi was lie upon the ground corrod and rust and
defac likewis the dog ketmehr was gone and noth save the brass
that was upon his collar remain they wonder much at these thing
but they took the money and they wrap about their bodi some leav
and came up to the top of the hill then were they perplex the
wonder templ of diana was gone mani grand edific they had never
seen befor stood in the citi men in strang garb move about the
street and everi thing was chang

johann said it hard seem like ephesus yet here is the great
gymnasium here is the mighti theatr wherein i have seen seventi
thousand men assembl here is the agora there is the font where the
saint john the baptist immers the convert yonder is the prison of
the good st paul where we all did use to go to touch the ancient chain
that bound him and be cure of our distemp i see the tomb of the
discipl luke and afar off is the church wherein repos the ash of the
holi john where the christian of ephesus go twice a year to gather the
dust from the tomb which is abl to make bodi whole again that are
corrupt by diseas and cleans the soul from sin but see how the
wharv encroach upon the sea and what multitud of ship are anchor
in the bay see also how the citi hath stretch abroad far over the
valley behind pion and even unto the wall of ayassalook and lo all
the hill are white with palac and rib with colonnad of marbl
how mighti is ephesus becom

and wonder at what their eye had seen they went down into the citi
and purchas garment and cloth themselv and when they would have
pass on the merchant bit the coin which they had given him with his
teeth and turn them about and look curious upon them and cast
them upon his counter and listen if they rang and then he said these
be bogus and they said depart thou to hade and went their way when
they were come to their hous they recogn them albeit they seem
old and mean and they rejoic and were glad they ran to the door
and knock and stranger open and look inquir upon them and
they said with great excit while their heart beat high and the
color in their face came and went where is my father where is my
mother where are dionysius and serapion and pericl and decius and
the stranger that open said we know not these the seven said how
you know them not how long have ye dwelt here and whither are they
gone that dwelt here befor ye and the stranger said ye play upon us
with a jest young men we and our father have sojourn under these
roof these six generat the name ye utter rot upon the tomb and
they that bore them have run their brief race have laugh and sung
have born the sorrow and the weari that were allot them and are
at rest for ninescor year the summer have come and gone and the
autumn leav have fallen sinc the rose fade out of their cheek and
they laid them to sleep with the dead

then the seven young men turn them away from their home and the
stranger shut the door upon them the wander marvel great and
look into the face of all they met as hope to find one that they
knew but all were strang and pass them by and spake no friend
word they were sore distress and sad present they spake unto a
citizen and said who is king in ephesus and the citizen answer and
said whenc come ye that ye know not that great laertius reign in
ephesus they look one at the other great perplex and present
ask again where then is the good king maximilianus the citizen
move him apart as one who is afraid and said verili these men be mad
and dream dream els would they know that the king whereof they speak
is dead abov two hundr year agon

then the scale fell from the eye of the seven and one said ala that
we drank of the curious liquor they have made us weari and in
dreamless sleep these two long centuri have we lain our home are
desol our friend are dead behold the jig is uplet us die and
that same day went they forth and laid them down and die and in that
selfsam day likewis the sevenup did ceas in ephesus for that the
seven that were up were down again and depart and dead withal and
the name that be upon their tomb even unto this time are johann
smithianus trump gift high and low jack and the game and with
the sleeper lie also the bottl wherein were onc the curious liquor
and upon them is writ in ancient letter such word as thesedam of
heathen god of olden time perchanc rumpunch jinsl egnog

such is the stori of the seven sleeper with slight variat and i
know it is true becaus i have seen the cave myself

realli so firm a faith had the ancient this legend that as late as
eight or nine hundr year ago learn travel held it in
superstiti fear two of them record that they ventur into it but
ran quick out again not dare to tarri lest they should fall asleep
and outliv their great grandchildren a centuri or so even at this day
the ignor denizen of the neighbor countri prefer not to sleep in
it




chapter xli

when i last made a memorandum we were at ephesus we are in syria now
encamp in the mountain of lebanon the interregnum has been long
both as to time and distanc we brought not a relic from ephesus
after gather up fragment of sculptur marbl and break ornament
from the interior work of the mosqu and after bring them at a cost
of infinit troubl and fatigu five mile on muleback to the railway
depot a govern offic compel all who had such thing to
disgorg he had an order from constantinopl to look out for our parti
and see that we carri noth off it was a wise a just and a
welldeserv rebuk but it creat a sensat i never resist a
temptat to plunder a stranger premis without feel insuffer
vain about it this time i felt proud beyond express i was seren
in the midst of the scold that were heap upon the ottoman
govern for it affront offer to a pleasur parti of entir
respect gentlemen and ladi i said we that have free soul it
touch us not  the shoe not onli pinch our parti but it pinch
hard a princip suffer discov that the imperi order was
inclos in an envelop bear the seal of the british embassi at
constantinopl and therefor must have been inspir by the
repres of the queen this was badveri bad come sole
from the ottoman it might have signifi onli ottoman hatr of
christian and a vulgar ignor as to genteel method of express
it but come from the christian educ polit british
legat it simpli intim that we were a sort of gentlemen and
ladi who would bear watch so the parti regard it and were
incens accord the truth doubtless was that the same
precaut would have been taken against ani travel becaus the
english compani who have acquir the right to excav ephesus and
have paid a great sum for that right need to be protect and deserv
to be they can not afford to run the risk of have their hospit
abus by travel especi sinc travel are such notori
scorner of honest behavior

we sail from smyrna in the wildest spirit of expect for the chief
featur the grand goal of the expedit was near at handw were
approach the holi land such a burrow into the hold for trunk
that had lain buri for week yes for month such a hurri to and
fro abov deck and below such a riotous system of pack and
unpack such a litter up of the cabin with shirt and skirt and
indescrib and unclass odd and end such a make up of bundl
and set apart of umbrella green spectacl and thick veil such a
critic inspect of saddl and bridl that had never yet touch
hors such a clean and load of revolv and examin of
bowiekn such a halfsol of the seat of pantaloon with
servic buckskin then such a pore over ancient map such a
read up of bibl and palestin travel such a mark out of
rout such exasper effort to divid up the compani into littl
band of congeni spirit who might make the long and arduous journey
without quarrel and morn noon and night such massmeet in
the cabin such speechmak such sage suggest such worri and
quarrel and such a general rais of the veri mischief was never
seen in the ship befor

but it is all over now we are cut up into parti of six or eight and
by this time are scatter far and wide our is the onli one howev
that is ventur on what is call the long tripthat is out into
syria by baalbec to damascus and thenc down through the full length of
palestin it would be a tedious and also a too riski journey at this
hot season of the year for ani but strong healthi men accustom
somewhat to fatigu and rough life in the open air the other parti
will take shorter journey

for the last two month we have been in a worri about one portion of this
holi land pilgrimag i refer to transport servic we knew veri
well that palestin was a countri which did not do a larg passeng
busi and everi man we came across who knew ani thing about it gave
us to understand that not half of our parti would be abl to get dragomen
and anim at constantinopl everi bodi fell to telegraph the
american consul at alexandria and beirout to give notic that we want
dragomen and transport we were desperatewould take hors
jackass cameleopard kangaroosani thing at smyrna more
telegraph was done to the same end also fear for the worst we
telegraph for a larg number of seat in the dilig for damascus
and hors for the ruin of baalbec

as might have been expect a notion got abroad in syria and egypt that
the whole popul of the provinc of america the turk consid us a
trifl littl provinc in some unvisit corner of the world were
come to the holi landand so when we got to beirout yesterday we
found the place full of dragomen and their outfit we had all intend
to go by dilig to damascus and switch off to baalbec as we went
alongbecaus we expect to rejoin the ship go to mount carmel and
take to the wood from there howev when our own privat parti of
eight found that it was possibl and proper enough to make the long
trip  we adopt that programm we have never been much troubl to a
consul befor but we have been a fear nuisanc to our consul at
beirout i mention this becaus i can not help admir his patienc
his industri and his accommod spirit i mention it also becaus i
think some of our ship compani did not give him as full credit for his
excel servic as he deserv

well out of our eight three were select to attend to all busi
connect with the expedit the rest of us had noth to do but look
at the beauti citi of beirout with it bright new hous nestl
among a wilder of green shrubberi spread abroad over an upland that
slope gentl down to the sea and also at the mountain of lebanon that
environ it and likewis to bath in the transpar blue water that
roll it billow about the ship we did not know there were shark
there we had also to rang up and down through the town and look at the
costum these are picturesqu and fanci but not so vari as at
constantinopl and smyrna the women of beirout add an agonyin the two
former citi the sex wear a thin veil which one can see through and
they often expos their ancl but at beirout they cover their entir
face with darkcolor or black veil so that they look like mummi
and then expos their breast to the public a young gentleman i
believ he was a greek volunt to show us around the citi and said
it would afford him great pleasur becaus he was studi english and
want practic in that languag when we had finish the round
howev he call for remunerationsaid he hope the gentlemen would
give him a trifl in the way of a few piastr equival to a few five
cent piec we did so the consul was surpris when he heard it and
said he knew the young fellow famili veri well and that they were an
old and high respect famili and worth a hundr and fifti thousand
dollar some peopl so situat would have been asham of the berth
he had with us and his manner of crawl into it

at the appoint time our busi committe report and said all
thing were in readdressthat we were to start today with hors pack
anim and tent and go to baalbec damascus the sea of tiberia and
thenc southward by the way of the scene of jacob dream and other
notabl bibl local to jerusalemfrom thenc probabl to the dead
sea but possibl notand then strike for the ocean and rejoin the ship
three or four week henc at joppa term five dollar a day apiec in
gold and everi thing to be furnish by the dragoman they said we
would lie as well as at a hotel i had read someth like that befor
and did not shame my judgment by believ a word of it i said noth
howev but pack up a blanket and a shawl to sleep in pipe and
tobacco two or three woollen shirt a portfolio a guidebook and a
bibl i also took along a towel and a cake of soap to inspir respect
in the arab who would take me for a king in disguis

we were to select our hors at  p m at that hour abraham the
dragoman marshal them befor us with all solemn i set it down
here that those hors were the hardest lot i ever did come across and
their accoutr were in exquisit keep with their style one
brute had an eye out anoth had his tail saw off close like a
rabbit and was proud of it anoth had a boni ridg run from his
neck to his tail like one of those ruin aqueduct one see about rome
and had a neck on him like a bowsprit they all limp and had sore
back and likewis raw place and old scale scatter about their
person like brass nail in a hair trunk their gait were marvel to
contempl and replet with varieti under way the process look
like a fleet in a storm it was fear blucher shook his head and
said

that dragon is go to get himself into troubl fetch these old
crate out of the hospit the way they are unless he has got a permit 

i said noth the display was exact accord to the guidebook and
were we not travel by the guidebook i select a certain hors
becaus i thought i saw him shi and i thought that a hors that had
spirit enough to shi was not to be despis

at  oclock p m we came to a halt here on the breezi summit of a
shape mountain overlook the sea and the handsom valley where dwelt
some of those enterpris phoenician of ancient time we read so much
about all around us are what were onc the dominion of hiram king of
tyre who furnish timber from the cedar of these lebanon hill to
build portion of king solomon templ with

short after six our pack train arriv i had not seen it befor and
a good right i had to be astonish we had nineteen serv men and
twentysix pack mule it was a perfect caravan it look like one
too as it wound among the rock i wonder what in the veri mischief
we want with such a vast turnout as that for eight men i wonder
awhil but soon i began to long for a tin plate and some bacon and
bean i had camp out mani and mani a time befor and knew just what
was come i went off without wait for serv men and unsaddl
my hors and wash such portion of his rib and his spine as project
through his hide and when i came back behold five state circus tent
were uptent that were brilliant within with blue and gold and
crimson and all manner of splendid adorn i was speechless then
they brought eight littl iron bedstead and set them up in the tent
they put a soft mattress and pillow and good blanket and two snowwhit
sheet on each bed next they rig a tabl about the centrepol and
on it place pewter pitcher basin soap and the whitest of towel
one set for each man they point to pocket in the tent and said we
could put our small trifl in them for conveni and if we need
pin or such thing they were stick everi where then came the
finish touchthey spread carpet on the floor i simpli said if
you call this camp out all rightbut it isnt the style i am use
to my littl baggag that i brought along is at a discount 

it grew dark and they put candl on the tablescandl set in bright
new brazen candlestick and soon the bella genuin simonpur bell
rang and we were invit to the saloon  i had thought befor that
we had a tent or so too mani but now here was one at least provid
for it was to be use for noth but an eatingsaloon like the
other it was high enough for a famili of giraff to live in and was
veri handsom and clean and brightcolor within it was a gem of a
place a tabl for eight and eight canva chair a tablecloth and
napkin whose white and whose fine laugh to scorn the thing we
were use to in the great excurs steamer knive and fork
soupplat dinnerplateseveri thing in the handsomest kind of
style it was wonder and they call this camp out those
state fellow in baggi trowser and turban fezz brought in a
dinner which consist of roast mutton roast chicken roast goos
potato bread tea pud appl and delici grape the viand
were better cook than ani we had eaten for week and the tabl made a
finer appear with it larg german silver candlestick and other
fineri than ani tabl we had sat down to for a good while and yet that
polit dragoman abraham came bow in and apolog for the whole
affair on account of the unavoid confus of get under way for
a veri long trip and promis to do a great deal better in futur

it is midnight now and we break camp at six in the morn

they call this camp out at this rate it is a glorious privileg to
be a pilgrim to the holi land




chapter xlii

we are camp near temninelfokaa name which the boy have simplifi
a good deal for the sake of conveni in spell they call it
jacksonvill it sound a littl strang here in the valley of
lebanon but it has the merit of be easier to rememb than the arab
name

come like spirit so depart 

the night shall be fill with music
and the care that infest the day
shall fold their tent like the arab
and as silent steal away 

i slept veri sound last night yet when the dragoman bell rang at
halfpast five this morn and the cri went abroad of ten minut to
dress for breakfast  i heard both it surpris me becaus i have not
heard the breakfast gong in the ship for a month and whenev we have
had occas to fire a salut at daylight i have onli found it out in
the cours of convers afterward howev camp out even though
it be in a gorgeous tent make one fresh and live in the morn
especi if the air you are breath is the cool fresh air of the
mountain

i was dress within the ten minut and came out the saloon tent had
been strip of it side and had noth left but it roof so when we
sat down to tabl we could look out over a nobl panorama of mountain
sea and hazi valley and sit thus the sun rose slowli up and
suffus the pictur with a world of rich color

hot mutton chop fri chicken omelett fri potato and coffe
all excel this was the bill of fare it was sauc with a savag
appetit purchas by hard ride the day befor and refresh sleep in
a pure atmospher as i call for a second cup of coffe i glanc
over my shoulder and behold our white villag was goneth splendid
tent had vanish like magic it was wonder how quick those arab
had fold their tent  and it was wonder also how quick they
had gather the thousand odd and end of the camp togeth and
disappear with them

by halfpast six we were under way and all the syrian world seem to be
under way also the road was fill with mule train and long
process of camel this remind me that we have been tri for some
time to think what a camel look like and now we have made it out when
he is down on all his knee flat on his breast to receiv his load he
look someth like a goos swim and when he is upright he look
like an ostrich with an extra set of leg camel are not beauti and
their long under lip give them an exceed gallusexcus the
slang no other word will describ itexpress they have immens
flat fork cushion of feet that make a track in the dust like a pie
with a slice cut out of it they are not particular about their diet
they would eat a tombston if they could bite it a thistl grow about
here which has needl on it that would pierc through leather i think
if one touch you you can find relief in noth but profan the
camel eat these they show by their action that they enjoy them i
suppos it would be a real treat to a camel to have a keg of nail for
supper

while i am speak of anim i will mention that i have a hors now by
the name of jericho  he is a mare i have seen remark hors
befor but none so remark as this i want a hors that could shi
and this one fill the bill i had an idea that shi indic spirit
if i was correct i have got the most spirit hors on earth he shi
at everi thing he come across with the utmost imparti he appear
to have a mortal dread of telegraph pole especi and it is
fortun that these are on both side of the road becaus as it is now
i never fall off twice in success on the same side if i fell on the
same side alway it would get to be monoton after a while this
creatur has scare at everi thing he has seen today except a haystack
he walk up to that with an intrepid and a reckless that were
astonish and it would fill ani one with admir to see how he
preserv his selfpossess in the presenc of a barley sack this
daredevil braveri will be the death of this hors some day

he is not particular fast but i think he will get me through the holi
land he has onli one fault his tail has been chop off or els he
has sat down on it too hard some time or other and he has to fight the
fli with his heel this is all veri well but when he tri to kick a
fli off the top of his head with his hind foot it is too much varieti
he is go to get himself into troubl that way some day he reach
around and bite my leg too i do not care particular about that
onli i do not like to see a hors too sociabl

i think the owner of this prize had a wrong opinion about him he had an
idea that he was one of those fieri untam steed but he is not of
that charact i know the arab had this idea becaus when he brought
the hors out for inspect in beirout he kept jerk at the bridl
and shout in arab ho will you do you want to run away you
feroci beast and break your neck  when all the time the hors was
not do anyth in the world and onli look like he want to lean
up against someth and think whenev he is not shi at thing or
reach after a fli he want to do that yet how it would surpris his
owner to know this

we have been in a histor section of countri all day at noon we
camp three hour and took luncheon at mekseh near the junction of the
lebanon mountain and the jebel el kuneiyiseh and look down into the
immens level gardenlik valley of lebanon tonight we are camp
near the same valley and have a veri wide sweep of it in view we can
see the long whaleback ridg of mount hermon project abov the
eastern hill the dew of hermon are fall upon us now and the
tent are almost soak with them

over the way from us and higher up the valley we can discern through
the glass the faint outlin of the wonder ruin of baalbec the
suppos baalgad of scriptur joshua and anoth person were the two
spi who were sent into this land of canaan by the children of israel to
report upon it characteri mean they were the spi who report
favor they took back with them some specimen of the grape of this
countri and in the children picturebook they are alway repres
as bear one monstrous bunch swung to a pole between them a
respect load for a packtrain the sundayschool book exagger
it a littl the grape are most excel to this day but the bunch
are not as larg as those in the pictur i was surpris and hurt when
i saw them becaus those coloss bunch of grape were one of my most
cherish juvenil tradit

joshua report favor and the children of israel journey on with
mose at the head of the general govern and joshua in command of the
armi of six hundr thousand fight men of women and children and
civilian there was a countless swarm of all that mighti host none but
the two faith spi ever live to set their feet in the promis land
they and their descend wander forti year in the desert and then
mose the gift warrior poet statesman and philosoph went up into
pisgah and met his mysteri fate where he was buri no man know
for

   no man dug that sepulchr
and no man saw it eer
 for the son of god upturn the sod
and laid the dead man there 

then joshua began his terribl raid and from jericho clear to this
baalgad he swept the land like the genius of destruct he
slaughter the peopl laid wast their soil and raze their citi to
the ground he wast thirtyon king also one may call it that
though realli it can hard be call wast them becaus there were
alway plenti of king in those day and to spare at ani rate he
destroy thirtyon king and divid up their realm among his
israelit he divid up this valley stretch out here befor us and
so it was onc jewish territori the jew have long sinc disappear
from it howev

back yonder an hour journey from here we pass through an arab
villag of stone drygood box they look like that where noah tomb
lie under lock and key noah built the ark  over these old hill and
valley the ark that contain all that was left of a vanish world onc
float

i make no apolog for detail the abov inform it will be news
to some of my reader at ani rate

noah tomb is built of stone and is cover with a long stone build
bucksheesh let us in the build had to be long becaus the grave of
the honor old navig is two hundr and ten feet long itself it is
onli about four feet high though he must have cast a shadow like a
lightningrod the proof that this is the genuin spot where noah was
buri can onli be doubt by uncommon incredul peopl the
evid is pretti straight shem the son of noah was present at the
burial and show the place to his descend who transmit the
knowledg to their descend and the lineal descend of these
introduc themselv to us today it was pleasant to make the
acquaint of member of so respect a famili it was a thing to be
proud of it was the next thing to be acquaint with noah himself

noah memor voyag will alway possess a live interest for me
henceforward

if ever an oppress race exist it is this one we see fetter around
us under the inhuman tyranni of the ottoman empir i wish europ would
let russia annihil turkey a littlenot much but enough to make it
difficult to find the place again without a diviningrod or a
divingbel the syrian are veri poor and yet they are ground down by
a system of taxat that would drive ani other nation frantic last
year their tax were heavi enough in all consciencebut this year
they have been increas by the addit of tax that were forgiven
them in time of famin in former year on top of this the govern
has levi a tax of onetenth of the whole proceed of the land this
is onli half the stori the pacha of a pachal doe not troubl
himself with appoint taxcollector he figur up what all these
tax ought to amount to in a certain district then he farm the
collect out he call the rich men togeth the highest bidder get
the specul pay the pacha on the spot and then sell out to
smaller fri who sell in turn to a pirat hord of still smaller fri
these latter compel the peasant to bring his littl trifl of grain to
the villag at his own cost it must be weigh the various tax set
apart and the remaind return to the produc but the collector
delay this duti day after day while the produc famili are
perish for bread at last the poor wretch who can not but understand
the game say take a quartertak halftak twothird if you will
and let me go  it is a most outrag state of thing

these peopl are natur goodheart and intellig and with
educ and liberti would be a happi and content race they often
appeal to the stranger to know if the great world will not some day come
to their relief and save them the sultan has been lavish money like
water in england and pari but his subject are suffer for it now

this fashion of camp out bewild me we have bootjack and a
bathtub now and yet all the mysteri the packmul carri are not
reveal what next




chapter xliii

we had a tedious ride of about five hour in the sun across the valley
of lebanon it prove to be not quit so much of a garden as it had
seem from the hillsid it was a desert weedgrown wast litter
thick with stone the size of a man fist here and there the nativ
had scratch the ground and rear a sick crop of grain but for the
most part the valley was given up to a hand of shepherd whose flock
were do what they honest could to get a live but the chanc were
against them we saw rude pile of stone stand near the roadsid at
interv and recogn the custom of mark boundari which obtain
in jacob time there were no wall no fenc no hedgesnoth to
secur a man possess but these random heap of stone the
israelit held them sacr in the old patriarch time and these other
arab their lineal descend do so likewis an american of
ordinari intellig would soon wide extend his properti at an
outlay of mere manual labor perform at night under so loos a system
of fenc as this

the plow these peopl use are simpli a sharpen stick such as abraham
plow with and they still winnow their wheat as he didthey pile it on
the housetop and then toss it by shovelful into the air until the
wind has blown all the chaff away they never invent ani thing never
learn ani thing

we had a fine race of a mile with an arab perch on a camel some of
the hors were fast and made veri good time but the camel scamper by
them without ani veri great effort the yell and shout and
whip and gallop of all parti interest made it an
exhilar excit and particular boister race

at eleven oclock our eye fell upon the wall and column of baalbec a
nobl ruin whose histori is a seal book it has stood there for
thousand of year the wonder and admir of travel but who built
it or when it was built are question that may never be answer one
thing is veri sure though such grandeur of design and such grace of
execut as one see in the templ of baalbec have not been equal
or even approach in ani work of men hand that has been built within
twenti centuri past

the great templ of the sun the templ of jupit and sever smaller
templ are cluster togeth in the midst of one of these miser
syrian villag and look strang enough in such plebeian compani
these templ are built upon massiv substruct that might support a
world almost the materi use are block of stone as larg as an
omnibusveri few if ani of them are smaller than a carpent tool
chestand these substruct are travers by tunnel of masonri
through which a train of car might pass with such foundat as
these it is littl wonder that baalbec has last so long the templ
of the sun is near three hundr feet long and one hundr and sixti
feet wide it had fiftyfour column around it but onli six are
stand nowth other lie broken at it base a confus and
picturesqu heap the six column are their base corinthian capit
and entablatureand six more shape column do not exist the column
and the entablatur togeth are nineti feet higha prodigi altitud
for shaft of stone to reach trulyand yet one onli think of their
beauti and symmetri when look at them the pillar look slender and
delic the entablatur with it elabor sculptur look like rich
stuccowork but when you have gaze aloft till your eye are weari you
glanc at the great fragment of pillar among which you are stand
and find that they are eight feet through and with them lie beauti
capit appar as larg as a small cottag and also singl slab of
stone superbl sculptur that are four or five feet thick and would
complet cover the floor of ani ordinari parlor you wonder where
these monstrous thing came from and it take some littl time to
satisfi yourself that the airi and grace fabric that tower abov your
head is made up of their mate it seem too preposter

the templ of jupit is a smaller ruin than the one i have been speak
of and yet is immens it is in a toler state of preserv one
row of nine column stand almost uninjur they are sixtyf feet
high and support a sort of porch or roof which connect them with the
roof of the build this porchroof is compos of tremend slab of
stone which are so fine sculptur on the under side that the work
look like a fresco from below one or two of these slab had fallen
and again i wonder if the gigant mass of carv stone that lay
about me were no larger than those abov my head within the templ the
ornament was elabor and coloss what a wonder of architectur
beauti and grandeur this edific must have been when it was new and
what a nobl pictur it and it stateli companion with the chao of
mighti fragment scatter about them yet make in the moonlight

i can not conceiv how those immens block of stone were ever haul
from the quarri or how they were ever rais to the dizzi height they
occupi in the templ and yet these sculptur block are trifl in
size compar with the roughhewn block that form the wide verandah or
platform which surround the great templ one stretch of that platform
two hundr feet long is compos of block of stone as larg and some
of them larger than a streetcar they surmount a wall about ten or
twelv feet high i thought those were larg rock but they sank into
insignific compar with those which form anoth section of the
platform these were three in number and i thought that each of them
was about as long as three street car place end to end though of
cours they are a third wider and a third higher than a street car
perhap two railway freight car of the largest pattern place end to
end might better repres their size in combin length these three
stone stretch near two hundr feet they are thirteen feet squar
two of them are sixtyfour feet long each and the third is sixtynin
they are built into the massiv wall some twenti feet abov the ground
they are there but how they got there is the question i have seen the
hull of a steamboat that was smaller than one of those stone all these
great wall are as exact and shape as the flimsi thing we build of
brick in these day a race of god or of giant must have inhabit
baalbec mani a centuri ago men like the men of our day could hard
rear such templ as these

we went to the quarri from whenc the stone of baalbec were taken it
was about a quarter of a mile off and down hill in a great pit lay the
mate of the largest stone in the ruin it lay there just as the giant
of that old forgotten time had left it when they were call hencejust
as they had left it to remain for thousand of year an eloqu rebuk
unto such as are prone to think slight of the men who live befor
them this enorm block lie there squar and readi for the
builder handsa solid mass fourteen feet by seventeen and but a few
inch less than seventi feet long two buggi could be driven abreast
of each other on it surfac from one end of it to the other and leav
room enough for a man or two to walk on either side

one might swear that all the john smith and georg wilkinson and all
the other piti nobodi between kingdom come and baalbec would
inscrib their poor littl name upon the wall of baalbec magnific
ruin and would add the town the counti and the state they came from
and swear thus be infal correct it is a piti some great ruin
doe not fall in and flatten out some of these reptil and scare their
kind out of ever give their name to fame upon ani wall or monument
again forev

proper with the sorri relic we bestrod it was a three day journey
to damascus it was necessari that we should do it in less than two
it was necessari becaus our three pilgrim would not travel on the
sabbath day we were all perfect will to keep the sabbath day but
there are time when to keep the letter of a sacr law whose spirit is
righteous becom a sin and this was a case in point we plead for
the tire illtreat hors and tri to show that their faith
servic deserv kind in return and their hard lot compass but
when did ever selfright know the sentiment of piti what were a
few long hour ad to the hardship of some overtax brute when
weigh against the peril of those human soul it was not the most
promis parti to travel with and hope to gain a higher vener for
religion through the exampl of it devote we said the saviour who
piti dumb beast and taught that the ox must be rescu from the mire
even on the sabbath day would not have counsel a forc march like
this we said the long trip was exhaust and therefor danger in
the blister heat of summer even when the ordinari day stage were
travers and if we persist in this hard march some of us might be
stricken down with the fever of the countri in consequ of it
noth could move the pilgrim they must press on men might die
hors might die but they must enter upon holi soil next week with no
sabbathbreak stain upon them thus they were will to commit a sin
against the spirit of religi law in order that they might preserv
the letter of it it was not worth while to tell them the letter
kill  i am talk now about person friend men whom i like men
who are good citizen who are honor upright conscienti but
whose idea of the saviour religion seem to me distort they lectur
our shortcom unspar and everi night they call us togeth and
read to us chapter from the testament that are full of gentl of
chariti and of tender merci and then all the next day they stick to
their saddl clear up to the summit of these rug mountain and
clear down again appli the testament gentl and chariti and
tender merci to a toil worn and weari hors nonsensethes are for
god human creatur not his dumb one what the pilgrim choos to
do respect for their almost sacr charact demand that i should allow
to passbut i would so like to catch ani other member of the parti
ride his hors up one of these exhaust hill onc

we have given the pilgrim a good mani exampl that might benefit them
but it is virtu thrown away they have never heard a cross word out of
our lip toward each otherbut they have quarrel onc or twice we
love to hear them at it after they have been lectur us the veri
first thing they did come ashor at beirout was to quarrel in the
boat i have said i like them and i do like thembut everi time they
read me a scorcher of a lectur i mean to talk back in print

not content with doubl the legitim stage they switch off the
main road and went away out of the way to visit an absurd fountain call
figia becaus baalam ass had drank there onc so we journey on
through the terribl hill and desert and the roast sun and then far
into the night seek the honor pool of baalam ass the patron
saint of all pilgrim like us i find no entri but this in my notebook

rode today altogeth thirteen hour through desert part
and part over barren unsight hill and latter through wild
rocki sceneri and camp at about eleven oclock at night on the
bank of a limpid stream near a syrian villag do not know it
namedo not wish to know itwant to go to bed two hors lame
mine and jack and the other worn out jack and i walk three
or four mile over the hill and led the hors funbut of a
mild type 

twelv or thirteen hour in the saddl even in a christian land and a
christian climat and on a good hors is a tiresom journey but in an
oven like syria in a rag spoon of a saddl that slip foreandaft
and thortship  and everi way and on a hors that is tire and lame
and yet must be whip and spur with hard a moment cessat all
day long till the blood come from his side and your conscienc hurt
you everi time you strike if you are half a man it is a journey to be
rememb in bitter of spirit and execr with emphasi for a
liber divis of a man lifetim




chapter xliv

the next day was an outrag upon men and hors both it was anoth
thirteenhour stretch includ an hour noon  it was over the
barrenest chalkhil and through the baldest canon that even syria can
show the heat quiver in the air everi where in the canon we almost
smother in the bake atmospher on high ground the reflect from
the chalkhil was blind it was cruel to urg the crippl hors
but it had to be done in order to make damascus saturday night we saw
ancient tomb and templ of fanci architectur carv out of the
solid rock high up in the face of precipic abov our head but we had
neither time nor strength to climb up there and examin them the ters
languag of my notebook will answer for the rest of this day

reach mahomet lookout perch over damascus in time to get a
good long look befor it was necessari to move on tire ask of
the wind that far away with fragment strew the sea 

as the glare of day mellow into twilight we look down upon a pictur
which is celebr all over the world i think i have read about four
hundr time that when mahomet was a simpl cameldriv he reach this
point and look down upon damascus for the first time and then made a
certain renown remark he said man could enter onli one paradis he
prefer to go to the one abov so he sat down there and feast his
eye upon the earth paradis of damascus and then went away without
enter it gate they have erect a tower on the hill to mark the
spot where he stood

damascus is beauti from the mountain it is beauti even to
foreign accustom to luxuri veget and i can easili
understand how unspeak beauti it must be to eye that are onli
use to the godforsaken barren and desol of syria i should
think a syrian would go wild with ecstaci when such a pictur burst upon
him for the first time

from his high perch one see befor him and below him a wall of dreari
mountain shorn of veget glare fierc in the sun it fenc in
a level desert of yellow sand smooth as velvet and thread far away
with fine line that stand for road and dot with creep mite we
know are cameltrain and journey men right in the midst of the
desert is spread a billowi expans of green foliag and nestl in it
heart sit the great white citi like an island of pearl and opal
gleam out of a sea of emerald this is the pictur you see spread
far below you with distanc to soften it the sun to glorifi it strong
contrast to heighten the effect and over it and about it a drows
air of repos to spiritu it and make it seem rather a beauti
estray from the mysteri world we visit in dream than a substanti
tenant of our coars dull globe and when you think of the leagu of
blight blast sandi rocki sunburnt ugli dreari infam
countri you have ridden over to get here you think it is the most
beauti beauti pictur that ever human eye rest upon in all the
broad univers if i were to go to damascus again i would camp on
mahomet hill about a week and then go away there is no need to go
insid the wall the prophet was wise without know it when he
decid not to go down into the paradis of damascus

there is an honor old tradit that the immens garden which damascus
stand in was the garden of eden and modern writer have gather up
mani chapter of evid tend to show that it realli was the garden
of eden and that the river pharpar and abana are the two rivers that
water adam paradis it may be so but it is not paradis now and
one would be as happi outsid of it as he would be like to be within
it is so crook and cramp and dirti that one can not realiz that he
is in the splendid citi he saw from the hilltop the garden are hidden
by high mudwal and the paradis is becom a veri sink of pollut
and uncomeli damascus has plenti of clear pure water in it
though and this is enough of itself to make an arab think it beauti
and bless water is scarc in blister syria we run railway by our
larg citi in america in syria they curv the road so as to make them
run by the meagr littl puddl they call fountain  and which are not
found often on a journey than everi four hour but the rivers of
pharpar and abana of scriptur mere creek run through damascus and
so everi hous and everi garden have their sparkl fountain and
rivulet of water with her forest of foliag and her abund of
water damascus must be a wonder of wonder to the bedouin from the
desert damascus is simpli an oasisthat is what it is for four
thousand year it water have not gone dri or it fertil fail
now we can understand whi the citi has exist so long it could not
die so long as it water remain to it away out there in the midst of
that howl desert so long will damascus live to bless the sight of the
tire and thirsti wayfar

though old as histori itself thou art fresh as the breath of
spring bloom as thine own rosebud and fragrant as thine own
orang flower o damascus pearl of the east 

damascus date back anterior to the day of abraham and is the oldest
citi in the world it was found by uz the grandson of noah the
earli histori of damascus is shroud in the mist of a hoari antiqu 
leav the matter written of in the first eleven chapter of the old
testament out and no record event has occur in the world but
damascus was in exist to receiv the news of it go back as far as
you will into the vagu past there was alway a damascus in the
write of everi centuri for more than four thousand year it name has
been mention and it prais sung to damascus year are onli
moment decad are onli flit trifl of time she measur time
not by day and month and year but by the empir she has seen rise
and prosper and crumbl to ruin she is a type of immort she saw
the foundat of baalbec and thebe and ephesus laid she saw these
villag grow into mighti citi and amaz the world with their
grandeurand she has live to see them desol desert and given
over to the owl and the bat she saw the israelitish empir exalt
and she saw it annihil she saw greec rise and flourish two
thousand year and die in her old age she saw rome built she saw it
overshadow the world with it power she saw it perish the few hundr
of year of genoes and venetian might and splendor were to grave old
damascus onli a trifl scintil hard worth rememb
damascus has seen all that has ever occur on earth and still she
live she has look upon the dri bone of a thousand empir and will
see the tomb of a thousand more befor she die though anoth claim
the name old damascus is by right the etern citi

we reach the citi gate just at sundown they do say that one can get
into ani wall citi of syria after night for bucksheesh except
damascus but damascus with it four thousand year of respect
in the world has mani old fogi notion there are no street lamp
there and the law compel all who go abroad at night to carri lantern
just as was the case in old day when hero and heroin of the arabian
night walk the street of damascus or flew away toward bagdad on
enchant carpet

it was fair dark a few minut after we got within the wall and we
rode long distanc through wonder crook street eight to ten
feet wide and shut in on either side by the high mudwal of the
garden at last we got to where lantern could be seen flit about
here and there and knew we were in the midst of the curious old citi
in a littl narrow street crowd with our packmul and with a swarm
of uncouth arab we alight and through a kind of a hole in the wall
enter the hotel we stood in a great flag court with flower and
citron tree about us and a huge tank in the centr that was receiv
the water of mani pipe we cross the court and enter the room
prepar to receiv four of us in a larg marblepav recess between
the two room was a tank of clear cool water which was kept run
over all the time by the stream that were pour into it from half a
dozen pipe noth in this scorch desol land could look so
refresh as this pure water flash in the lamplight noth could
look so beauti noth could sound so delici as this mimic rain to
ear long unaccustom to sound of such a natur our room were larg
comfort furnish and even had their floor cloth with soft
cheerfultint carpet it was a pleasant thing to see a carpet again
for if there is ani thing drearier than the tomblik stonepav
parlor and bedroom of europ and asia i do not know what it is
they make one think of the grave all the time a veri broad gaili
caparison divan some twelv or fourteen feet long extend across one
side of each room and opposit were singl bed with spring mattress
there were great lookingglass and marbletop tabl all this luxuri
was as grate to system and sens worn out with an exhaust day
travel as it was unexpectedfor one can not tell what to expect in a
turkish citi of even a quarter of a million inhabit

i do not know but i think they use that tank between the room to draw
drink water from that did not occur to me howev until i had
dip my bake head far down into it cool depth i thought of it
then and superb as the bath was i was sorri i had taken it and was
about to go and explain to the landlord but a fine curl and scent
poodl dog frisk up and nip the calf of my leg just then and befor
i had time to think i had sous him to the bottom of the tank and when
i saw a servant come with a pitcher i went off and left the pup tri
to climb out and not succeed veri well satisfi reveng was all i
need to make me perfect happi and when i walk in to supper that
first night in damascus i was in that condit we lay on those divan
a long time after supper smoke narghili and longstem chibouk
and talk about the dread ride of the day and i knew then what i
had sometim known beforethat it is worth while to get tire out
becaus one so enjoy rest afterward

in the morn we sent for donkey it is worthi of note that we had to
send for these thing i said damascus was an old fossil and she is
ani where els we would have been assail by a clamor armi of
donkeydriv guid peddler and beggarsbut in damascus they so
hate the veri sight of a foreign christian that they want no intercours
whatev with him onli a year or two ago his person was not alway
safe in damascus street it is the most fanat mohammedan purgatori
out of arabia where you see one green turban of a hadji elsewher the
honor sign that my lord has made the pilgrimag to mecca i think you
will see a dozen in damascus the damascen are the ugliest wickedest
look villain we have seen all the veil women we had seen yet
near left their eye expos but number of these in damascus
complet hid the face under a closedrawn black veil that made the
woman look like a mummi if ever we caught an eye expos it was
quick hidden from our contamin christian vision the beggar
actual pass us by without demand bucksheesh the merchant in the
bazaar did not hold up their good and cri out eager hey john 
or look this howajji  on the contrari they onli scowl at us and
said never a word

the narrow street swarm like a hive with men and women in strang
orient costum and our small donkey knock them right and left as
we plow through them urg on by the merciless donkeyboy these
persecutor run after the anim shout and goad them for hour
togeth they keep the donkey in a gallop alway yet never get tire
themselv or fall behind the donkey fell down and spilt us over their
head occasion but there was noth for it but to mount and hurri
on again we were bang against sharp corner load porter camel
and citizen general and we were so taken up with look out for
collis and casualti that we had no chanc to look about us at all
we rode half through the citi and through the famous street which is
call straight without see ani thing hard our bone were near
knock out of joint we were wild with excit and our side ach
with the jolt we had suffer i do not like ride in the damascus
streetcar

we were on our way to the reput hous of juda and anania about
eighteen or nineteen hundr year ago saul a nativ of tarsus was
particular bitter against the new sect call christian and he left
jerusalem and start across the countri on a furious crusad against
them he went forth breath threaten and slaughter against the
discipl of the lord 

and as he journey he came near damascus and sudden there
shine round about him a light from heaven

and he fell to the earth and heard a voic say unto him saul
saul whi persecutest thou me 

and when he knew that it was jesus that spoke to him he trembl
and was astonish and said lord what wilt thou have me to do 

he was told to aris and go into the ancient citi and one would tell
him what to do in the meantim his soldier stood speechless and
awestricken for they heard the mysteri voic but saw no man saul
rose up and found that that fierc supernatur light had destroy his
sight and he was blind so they led him by the hand and brought him to
damascus  he was convert

paul lay three day blind in the hous of juda and dure that time
he neither ate nor drank

there came a voic to a citizen of damascus name anania say
aris and go into the street which is call straight and inquir at
the hous of juda for one call saul of tarsus for behold he
prayeth 

anania did not wish to go at first for he had heard of saul befor and
he had his doubt about that style of a chosen vessel to preach the
gospel of peac howev in obedi to order he went into the
street call straight how he found his way into it and after he did
how he ever found his way out of it again are mysteri onli to be
account for by the fact that he was act under divin inspir
he found paul and restor him and ordain him a preacher and from
this old hous we had hunt up in the street which is miscal
straight he had start out on that bold missionari career which he
prosecut till his death it was not the hous of the discipl who sold
the master for thirti piec of silver i make this explan in
justic to juda who was a far differ sort of man from the person
just refer to a veri differ style of man and live in a veri
good hous it is a piti we do not know more about him

i have given in the abov paragraph some more inform for peopl
who will not read bibl histori until they are defraud into it by some
such method as this i hope that no friend of progress and educ
will obstruct or interfer with my peculiar mission

the street call straight is straighter than a corkscrew but not as
straight as a rainbow st luke is care not to commit himself he
doe not say it is the street which is straight but the street which is
call straight  it is a fine piec of ironi it is the onli faceti
remark in the bibl i believ we travers the street call straight
a good way and then turn off and call at the reput hous of
anania there is small question that a part of the origin hous is
there still it is an old room twelv or fifteen feet under ground and
it masonri is evid ancient if anania did not live there in st
paul time somebodi els did which is just as well i took a drink
out of anania well and singular enough the water was just as fresh
as if the well had been dug yesterday

we went out toward the north end of the citi to see the place where the
discipl let paul down over the damascus wall at dead of nightfor he
preach christ so fearless in damascus that the peopl sought to kill
him just as they would today for the same offens and he had to escap
and flee to jerusalem

then we call at the tomb of mahomet children and at a tomb which
purport to be that of st georg who kill the dragon and so on out
to the hollow place under a rock where paul hid dure his flight till
his pursuer gave him up and to the mausoleum of the five thousand
christian who were massacr in damascus in  by the turk they say
those narrow street ran blood for sever day and that men women and
children were butcher indiscrimin and left to rot by hundr all
through the christian quarter they say further that the stench was
dread all the christian who could get away fled from the citi and
the mohammedan would not defil their hand by buri the infidel
dog  the thirst for blood extend to the high land of hermon and
antilebanon and in a short time twentyf thousand more christian
were massacr and their possess laid wast how they hate a
christian in damascus and pretti much all over turkeydom as well and
how they will pay for it when russia turn her gun upon them again

it is sooth to the heart to abus england and franc for interpos
to save the ottoman empir from the destruct it has so rich deserv
for a thousand year it hurt my vaniti to see these pagan refus to
eat of food that has been cook for us or to eat from a dish we have
eaten from or to drink from a goatskin which we have pollut with our
christian lip except by filter the water through a rag which they
put over the mouth of it or through a spong i never dislik a
chinaman as i do these degrad turk and arab and when russia is readi
to war with them again i hope england and franc will not find it good
breed or good judgment to interfer

in damascus they think there are no such river in all the world as their
littl abana and pharpar the damascen have alway thought that way
in  king chapter v naaman boast extravag about them that was
three thousand year ago he say are not abana and pharpar river of
damascus better than all the water of israel may i not wash in them
and be clean  but some of my reader have forgotten who naaman was
long ago naaman was the command of the syrian armi he was the
favorit of the king and live in great state he was a mighti man of
valor but he was a leper  strang enough the hous they point out
to you now as his has been turn into a leper hospit and the inmat
expos their horrid deform and hold up their hand and beg for
bucksheesh when a stranger enter

one can not appreci the horror of this diseas until he look upon it
in all it ghastli in naaman ancient dwell in damascus bone
all twist out of shape great knot protrud from face and bodi
joint decay and drop awayhorr




chapter xlv

the last twentyfour hour we staid in damascus i lay prostrat with a
violent attack of cholera or cholera morbus and therefor had a good
chanc and a good excus to lie there on that wide divan and take an
honest rest i had noth to do but listen to the patter of the
fountain and take medicin and throw it up again it was danger
recreat but it was pleasant than travel in syria i had plenti
of snow from mount hermon and as it would not stay on my stomach there
was noth to interfer with my eat itther was alway room for
more i enjoy myself veri well syrian travel has it interest
featur like travel in ani other part of the world and yet to break
your leg or have the cholera add a welcom varieti to it

we left damascus at noon and rode across the plain a coupl of hour and
then the parti stop a while in the shade of some figtre to give me
a chanc to rest it was the hottest day we had seen yetth sunflam
shot down like the shaft of fire that stream out befor a blowpipeth
ray seem to fall in a steadi delug on the head and pass downward like
rain from a roof i imagin i could distinguish between the flood of
raysi thought i could tell when each flood struck my head when it
reach my shoulder and when the next one came it was terribl all
the desert glare so fierc that my eye were swim in tear all the
time the boy had white umbrella heavili line with dark green they
were a priceless bless i thank fortun that i had one too
notwithstand it was pack up with the baggag and was ten mile
ahead it is mad to travel in syria without an umbrella they told
me in beirout these peopl who alway gorg you with advic that it was
mad to travel in syria without an umbrella it was on this account
that i got one

but honest i think an umbrella is a nuisanc ani where when it
busi is to keep the sun off no arab wear a brim to his fez or
use an umbrella or ani thing to shade his eye or his face and he
alway look comfort and proper in the sun but of all the
ridicul sight i ever have seen our parti of eight is the most so
they do cut such an outlandish figur they travel singl file they all
wear the endless white rag of constantinopl wrap round and round
their hat and dangl down their back they all wear thick green
spectacl with sideglass to them they all hold white umbrella
line with green over their head without except their stirrup are
too shortthey are the veri worst gang of horsemen on earth their
anim to a hors trot fear hardand when they get strung out one
after the other glare straight ahead and breathless bounc high and
out of turn all along the line knee well up and stiff elbow flap
like a rooster that is go to crow and the long file of umbrella
pop convuls up and downwhen one see this outrag pictur
expos to the light of day he is amaz that the god dont get out
their thunderbolt and destroy them off the face of the earth i doi
wonder at it i wouldnt let ani such caravan go through a countri of
mine

and when the sun drop below the horizon and the boy close their
umbrella and put them under their arm it is onli a variat of the
pictur not a modif of it absurd

but may be you can not see the wild extravag of my panorama you
could if you were here here you feel all the time just as if you were
live about the year  befor christor back to the patriarchsor
forward to the new era the sceneri of the bibl is about youth
custom of the patriarch are around youth same peopl in the same
flow robe and in sandal cross your pathth same long train of
state camel go and cometh same impress religi solemn and
silenc rest upon the desert and the mountain that were upon them in the
remot age of antiqu and behold intrud upon a scene like this
come this fantast mob of greenspectacl yank with their flap
elbow and bob umbrella it is daniel in the lion den with a
green cotton umbrella under his arm all over again

my umbrella is with the baggag and so are my green spectaclesand
there they shall stay i will not use them i will show some respect
for the etern fit of thing it will be bad enough to get
sunstruck without look ridicul into the bargain if i fall
let me fall bear about me the semblanc of a christian at least

three or four hour out from damascus we pass the spot where saul was
so abrupt convert and from this place we look back over the
scorch desert and had our last glimps of beauti damascus deck
in it robe of shine green after nightfal we reach our tent
just outsid of the nasti arab villag of jonesborough of cours the
real name of the place is el someth or other but the boy still
refus to recogn the arab name or tri to pronounc them when i say
that that villag is of the usual style i mean to insinu that all
syrian villag within fifti mile of damascus are alikeso much alik
that it would requir more than human intellig to tell wherein one
differ from anoth a syrian villag is a hive of hut one stori high
the height of a man and as squar as a drygood box it is
mudplast all over flat roof and all and general whitewash
after a fashion the same roof often extend over half the town
cover mani of the street which are general about a yard wide
when you ride through one of these villag at noonday you first meet
a melancholi dog that look up at you and silent beg that you wont
run over him but he doe not offer to get out of the way next you meet
a young boy without ani cloth on and he hold out his hand and say
bucksheesh  he dont realli expect a cent but then he learn to
say that befor he learn to say mother and now he can not break
himself of it next you meet a woman with a black veil drawn close
over her face and her bust expos final you come to sever
soreey children and children in all stage of mutil and decay
and sit humbl in the dust and all fring with filthi rag is a
poor devil whose arm and leg are gnarl and twist like grapevin
these are all the peopl you are like to see the balanc of the
popul are asleep within door or abroad tend goat in the
plain and on the hillsid the villag is built on some consumpt
littl watercours and about it is a littl freshlook veget
beyond this charm circl for mile on everi side stretch a weari
desert of sand and gravel which produc a gray bunchi shrub like
sagebrush a syrian villag is the sorriest sight in the world and
it surround are emin in keep with it

i would not have gone into this dissert upon syrian villag but for
the fact that nimrod the mighti hunter of scriptur notorieti is
buri in jonesborough and i wish the public to know about how he is
locat like homer he is said to be buri in mani other place but
this is the onli true and genuin place his ash inhabit

when the origin tribe were dispers more than four thousand year
ago nimrod and a larg parti travel three or four hundr mile and
settl where the great citi of babylon afterward stood nimrod built
that citi he also began to build the famous tower of babel but
circumst over which he had no control put it out of his power to
finish it he ran it up eight stori high howev and two of them
still stand at this daya coloss mass of brickwork rent down the
centr by earthquak and sear and vitrifi by the lightn of an
angri god but the vast ruin will still stand for age to shame the
puni labor of these modern generat of men it huge compart
are tenant by owl and lion and old nimrod lie neglect in this
wretch villag far from the scene of his grand enterpris

we left jonesborough veri earli in the morn and rode forev and
forev and forev it seem to me over parch desert and rocki
hill hungri and with no water to drink we had drain the goatskin
dri in a littl while at noon we halt befor the wretch arab town
of el yuba dam perch on the side of a mountain but the dragoman said
if we appli there for water we would be attack by the whole tribe
for they did not love christian we had to journey on two hour later
we reach the foot of a tall isol mountain which is crown by the
crumbl castl of bania the stateliest ruin of that kind on earth no
doubt it is a thousand feet long and two hundr wide all of the most
symmetr and at the same time the most ponder masonri the
massiv tower and bastion are more than thirti feet high and have been
sixti from the mountain peak it broken turret rise abov the grove
of ancient oak and oliv and look wonder picturesqu it is of
such high antiqu that no man know who built it or when it was built
it is utter inaccess except in one place where a bridlepath
wind upward among the solid rock to the old portculli the hors
hoof have bore hole in these rock to the depth of six inch dure
the hundr and hundr of year that the castl was garrison we
wander for three hour among the chamber and crypt and dungeon of
the fortress and trod where the mail heel of mani a knight crusad
had rang and where phenician hero had walk age befor them

we wonder how such a solid mass of masonri could be affect even by an
earthquak and could not understand what agenc had made bania a ruin
but we found the destroy after a while and then our wonder was
increas tenfold seed had fallen in crevic in the vast wall the
seed had sprout the tender insignific sprout had harden they
grew larger and larger and by a steadi impercept pressur forc
the great stone apart and now are bring sure destruct upon a
giant work that has even mock the earthquak to scorn gnarl and
twist tree spring from the old wall everi where and beautifi and
overshadow the gray battlement with a wild luxuri of foliag

from these old tower we look down upon a broad farreach green
plain glitter with the pool and rivulet which are the sourc of
the sacr river jordan it was a grate vision after so much desert

and as the even drew near we clamber down the mountain through
grove of the biblic oak of bashan for we were just step over
the border and enter the longsought holi land and at it extrem
foot toward the wide valley we enter this littl execr villag of
bania and camp in a great grove of oliv tree near a torrent of
sparkl water whose bank are array in figtre pomegran and
oleand in full leaf bar the proxim of the villag it is a
sort of paradis

the veri first thing one feel like do when he get into camp all
burn up and dusti is to hunt up a bath we follow the stream up to
where it gush out of the mountain side three hundr yard from the
tent and took a bath that was so ici that if i did not know this was
the main sourc of the sacr river i would expect harm to come of it
it was bath at noonday in the chilli sourc of the abana river of
damascus  that gave me the cholera so dr b said howev it
general doe give me the cholera to take a bath

the incorrig pilgrim have come in with their pocket full of
specimen broken from the ruin i wish this vandal could be stop
they broke off fragment from noah tomb from the exquisit sculptur
of the templ of baalbec from the hous of juda and anania in
damascus from the tomb of nimrod the mighti hunter in jonesborough from
the worn greek and roman inscript set in the hoari wall of the
castl of bania and now they have been hack and chip these old
arch here that jesus look upon in the flesh heaven protect the
sepulchr when this tribe invad jerusalem

the ruin here are not veri interest there are the massiv wall of
a great squar build that was onc the citadel there are mani
ponder old arch that are so smother with debri that they bare
project abov the ground there are heavywal sewer through which the
crystal brook of which jordan is born still run in the hillsid are
the substruct of a cost marbl templ that herod the great built
herepatch of it handsom mosaic floor still remain there is a
quaint old stone bridg that was here befor herod time may be
scatter everi where in the path and in the wood are corinthian
capit broken porphyri pillar and littl fragment of sculptur and
up yonder in the precipic where the fountain gush out are wellworn
greek inscript over nich in the rock where in ancient time the
greek and after them the roman worship the sylvan god pan but
tree and bush grow abov mani of these ruin now the miser hut
of a littl crew of filthi arab are perch upon the broken masonri of
antiqu the whole place has a sleepi stupid rural look about it and
one can hard bring himself to believ that a busi substanti built
citi onc exist here even two thousand year ago the place was
nevertheless the scene of an event whose effect have ad page after
page and volum after volum to the world histori for in this place
christ stood when he said to peter

thou art peter and upon this rock will i build my church and the
gate of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto
thee the key of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoev thou shalt
bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoev thou shalt
loos on earth shall be loos in heaven 

on those littl sentenc have been built up the mighti edific of the
church of rome in them lie the author for the imperi power of the
pope over tempor affair and their godlik power to curs a soul or
wash it white from sin to sustain the posit of the onli true
church  which rome claim was thus confer upon her she has fought
and labor and struggl for mani a centuri and will continu to keep
herself busi in the same work to the end of time the memor word i
have quot give to this ruin citi about all the interest it possess
to peopl of the present day

it seem curious enough to us to be stand on ground that was onc
actual press by the feet of the saviour the situat is suggest
of a realiti and a tangibl that seem at varianc with the vagu
and mysteri and ghostli that one natur attach to the charact
of a god i can not comprehend yet that i am sit where a god has
stood and look upon the brook and the mountain which that god look
upon and am surround by duski men and women whose ancestor saw him
and even talk with him face to face and careless just as they
would have done with ani other stranger i can not comprehend this the
god of my understand have been alway hidden in cloud and veri far
away

this morn dure breakfast the usual assemblag of squalid human
sat patient without the charm circl of the camp and wait for such
crumb as piti might bestow upon their miseri there were old and young
brownskin and yellow some of the men were tall and stalwart for
one hard see ani where such splendidlook men as here in the east
but all the women and children look worn and sad and distress with
hunger they remind me much of indian did these peopl they had
but littl cloth but such as they had was fanci in charact and
fantast in it arrang ani littl absurd gewgaw or gimcrack they
had they dispos in such a way as to make it attract attent most
readili they sat in silenc and with tireless patienc watch our
everi motion with that vile uncomplain impolit which is so truli
indian and which make a white man so nervous and uncomfort and
savag that he want to extermin the whole tribe

these peopl about us had other peculiar which i have notic in
the nobl red man too they were infest with vermin and the dirt had
cake on them till it amount to bark

the littl children were in a pitiabl conditionthey all had sore eye
and were otherwis afflict in various way they say that hard a
nativ child in all the east is free from sore eye and that thousand
of them go blind of one eye or both everi year i think this must be so
for i see plenti of blind peopl everi day and i do not rememb see
ani children that hadnt sore eye and would you suppos that an
american mother could sit for an hour with her child in her arm and
let a hundr fli roost upon it eye all that time undisturb i see
that everi day it make my flesh creep yesterday we met a woman
ride on a littl jackass and she had a littl child in her arm
honest i thought the child had goggl on as we approach and i
wonder how it mother could afford so much style but when we drew
near we saw that the goggl were noth but a camp meet of fli
assembl around each of the child eye and at the same time there was
a detach prospect it nose the fli were happi the child was
content and so the mother did not interfer

as soon as the tribe found out that we had a doctor in our parti they
began to flock in from all quarter dr b in the chariti of his
natur had taken a child from a woman who sat near by and put some sort
of a wash upon it diseas eye that woman went off and start the
whole nation and it was a sight to see them swarm the lame the halt
the blind the leprousal the distemp that are bred of indol
dirt and iniquitywer repres in the congress in ten minut and
still they came everi woman that had a sick babi brought it along and
everi woman that hadnt borrow one what rever and what worship
look they bent upon that dread mysteri power the doctor they
watch him take his phial out they watch him measur the particl
of white powder they watch him add drop of one precious liquid and
drop of anoth they lost not the slightest movement their eye were
rivet upon him with a fascin that noth could distract
i believ they thought he was gift like a god when each individu
got his portion of medicin his eye were radiant with joy
notwithstand by natur they are a thankless and impass raceand
upon his face was written the unquest faith that noth on earth
could prevent the patient from get well now

christ knew how to preach to these simpl superstiti
diseasetortur creatur he heal the sick they flock to our
poor human doctor this morn when the fame of what he had done to the
sick child went abroad in the land and they worship him with their
eye while they did not know as yet whether there was virtu in his
simpl or not the ancestor of thesepeopl precis like them in
color dress manner custom simplicityflock in vast multitud
after christ and when they saw him make the afflict whole with a
word it is no wonder they worship him no wonder his deed were the
talk of the nation no wonder the multitud that follow him was so
great that at one timethirti mile from herethey had to let a sick
man down through the roof becaus no approach could be made to the door
no wonder his audienc were so great at galile that he had to preach
from a ship remov a littl distanc from the shore no wonder that
even in the desert place about bethsaida five thousand invad his
solitud and he had to feed them by a miracl or els see them suffer
for their confid faith and devot no wonder when there was a great
commot in a citi in those day one neighbor explain it to anoth
in word to this effect they say that jesus of nazareth is come 

well as i was say the doctor distribut medicin as long as he had
ani to distribut and his reput is mighti in galile this day
among his patient was the child of the shiek daughterfor even this
poor rag hand of sore and sin has it royal shieka poor old
mummi that look as if he would be more at home in a poorhous than in
the chief magistraci of this tribe of hopeless shirtless savag the
princessi mean the shiek daughterwa onli thirteen or fourteen
year old and had a veri sweet face and a pretti one she was the onli
syrian femal we have seen yet who was not so sin ugli that she
couldnt smile after ten oclock saturday night without break the
sabbath her child was a hard specimen thoughther wasnt enough of
it to make a pie and the poor littl thing look so plead up at
all who came near it as if it had an idea that now was it chanc or
never that we were fill with compass which was genuin and not put
on

but this last new hors i have got is tri to break his neck over the
tentrop and i shall have to go out and anchor him jericho and i
have part compani the new hors is not much to boast of i think
one of his hind leg bend the wrong way and the other one is as
straight and stiff as a tentpol most of his teeth are gone and he is
as blind as bat his nose has been broken at some time or other and is
arch like a culvert now his under lip hang down like a camel and
his ear are chop off close to his head i had some troubl at first
to find a name for him but i final conclud to call him baalbec
becaus he is such a magnific ruin i can not keep from talk about
my hors becaus i have a veri long and tedious journey befor me and
they natur occupi my thought about as much as matter of appar
much greater import

we satisfi our pilgrim by make those hard ride from baalbec to
damascus but dan hors and jack were so crippl we had to leav
them behind and get fresh anim for them the dragoman say jack
hors die i swap hors with moham the kinglylook egyptian
who is our ferguson lieuten by ferguson i mean our dragoman
abraham of cours i did not take this hors on account of his person
appear but becaus i have not seen his back i do not wish to see
it i have seen the back of all the other hors and found most of
them cover with dread saddleboil which i know have not been wash
or doctor for year the idea of ride all day long over such ghast
inquisit of tortur is sicken my hors must be like the other
but i have at least the consol of not know it to be so

i hope that in futur i may be spare ani more sentiment prais of the
arab idolatri of his hors in boyhood i long to be an arab of the
desert and have a beauti mare and call her selim or benjamin or
moham and feed her with my own hand and let her come into the tent
and teach her to caress me and look fond upon me with her great tender
eye and i wish that a stranger might come at such a time and offer me
a hundr thousand dollar for her so that i could do like the other
arabshesit yearn for the money but overcom by my love for my
mare at last say part with thee my beauti one never with my
life away tempter i scorn thi gold  and then bound into the saddl
and speed over the desert like the wind

but i recal those aspir if these arab be like the other arab
their love for their beauti mare is a fraud these of my
acquaint have no love for their hors no sentiment of piti for
them and no knowledg of how to treat them or care for them the syrian
saddleblanket is a quilt mattress two or three inch thick it is
never remov from the hors day or night it get full of dirt and
hair and becom soak with sweat it is bound to breed sore these
pirat never think of wash a hors back they do not shelter the
hors in the tent eitherthey must stay out and take the weather as
it come look at poor crop and dilapid baalbec  and weep for
the sentiment that has been wast upon the selim of romanc




chapter xlvi

about an hour ride over a rough rocki road half flood with water
and through a forest of oak of bashan brought us to dan

from a littl mound here in the plain issu a broad stream of limpid
water and form a larg shallow pool and then rush furious onward
augment in volum this puddl is an import sourc of the jordan
it bank and those of the brook are respect adorn with bloom
oleand but the unutter beauti of the spot will not throw a
wellbalanc man into convuls as the syrian book of travel would
lead one to suppos

from the spot i am speak of a cannonbal would carri beyond the
confin of holi land and light upon profan ground three mile away
we were onli one littl hour travel within the border of holi landw
had hard begun to appreci yet that we were stand upon ani
differ sort of earth than that we had alway been use to and see how
the histor name began alreadi to cluster danbashanlak huleh
the sourc of jordanth sea of galile they were all in sight but
the last and it was not far away the littl township of bashan was
onc the kingdom so famous in scriptur for it bull and it oak
lake huleh is the biblic water of merom  dan was the northern and
beersheba the southern limit of palestineh the express from dan
to beersheba  it is equival to our phrase from main to texas
from baltimor to san francisco  our express and that of the
israelit both mean the samegreat distanc with their slow camel
and ass it was about a seven day journey from dan to beershebasay
a hundr and fifti or sixti milesit was the entir length of their
countri and was not to be undertaken without great prepar and much
ceremoni when the prodig travel to a far countri  it is not
like that he went more than eighti or nineti mile palestin is onli
from forti to sixti mile wide the state of missouri could be split
into three palestin and there would then be enough materi left for
part of anotherposs a whole one from baltimor to san francisco
is sever thousand mile but it will be onli a seven day journey in
the car when i am two or three year older the railroad has been
complet sinc the abov was written if i live i shall necessarili
have to go across the contin everi now and then in those car but one
journey from dan to beersheba will be suffici no doubt it must be
the most tri of the two therefor if we chanc to discov that
from dan to beersheba seem a mighti stretch of countri to the
israelit let us not be airi with them but reflect that it was and is
a mighti stretch when one can not travers it by rail

the small mound i have mention a while ago was onc occupi by the
phenician citi of laish a parti of filibust from zorah and eschol
captur the place and live there in a free and easi way worship
god of their own manufactur and steal idol from their neighbor
whenev they wore their own out jeroboam set up a golden calf here to
fascin his peopl and keep them from make danger trip to
jerusalem to worship which might result in a return to their right
allegi with all respect for those ancient israelit i can not
overlook the fact that they were not alway virtuous enough to withstand
the seduct of a golden calf human natur has not chang much sinc
then

some forti centuri ago the citi of sodom was pillag by the arab
princ of mesopotamia and among other prison they seiz upon the
patriarch lot and brought him here on their way to their own possess
they brought him to dan and father abraham who was pursu them crept
soft in at dead of night among the whisper oleand and under the
shadow of the state oak and fell upon the slumber victor and
startl them from their dream with the clash of steel he recaptur
lot and all the other plunder

we move on we were now in a green valley five or six mile wide and
fifteen long the stream which are call the sourc of the jordan
flow through it to lake huleh a shallow pond three mile in diamet
and from the southern extrem of the lake the concentr jordan flow
out the lake is surround by a broad marsh grown with reed between
the marsh and the mountain which wall the valley is a respect strip
of fertil land at the end of the valley toward dan as much as half
the land is solid and fertil and water by jordan sourc there is
enough of it to make a farm it almost warrant the enthusiasm of the
spi of that rabbl of adventur who captur dan they said we
have seen the land and behold it is veri good    a place where
there is no want of ani thing that is in the earth 

their enthusiasm was at least warrant by the fact that they had never
seen a countri as good as this there was enough of it for the ampl
support of their six hundr men and their famili too

when we got fair down on the level part of the danit farm we came to
place where we could actual run our hors it was a notabl
circumst

we had been pain clamber over intermin hill and rock for
day togeth and when we sudden came upon this astonish piec of
rockless plain everi man drove the spur into his hors and sped away
with a veloc he could sure enjoy to the utmost but could never hope
to comprehend in syria

here were evid of cultivationa rare sight in this countryan acr
or two of rich soil stud with last season dead cornstalk of the
thick of your thumb and veri wide apart but in such a land it was a
thrill spectacl close to it was a stream and on it bank a great
herd of curiouslook syrian goat and sheep were grate eat
gravel i do not state this as a petrifi facti onli suppos they
were eat gravel becaus there did not appear to be ani thing els for
them to eat the shepherd that tend them were the veri pictur of
joseph and his brethren i have no doubt in the world they were tall
muscular and veri darkskin bedouin with inki black beard they
had firm lip unquail eye and a king stateli of bear
they wore the particolor half bonnet half hood with fring end
fall upon their shoulder and the full flow robe bar with
broad black stripesth dress one see in all pictur of the swarthi
son of the desert these chap would sell their younger brother if
they had a chanc i think they have the manner the custom the
dress the occup and the loos principl of the ancient stock
they attack our camp last night and i bear them no good will 
they had with them the pigmi jackass one see all over syria and
rememb in all pictur of the flight into egypt  where mari and the
young child are ride and joseph is walk alongsid tower high
abov the littl donkey shoulder

but realli here the man ride and carri the child as a general thing
and the woman walk the custom have not chang sinc joseph time
we would not have in our hous a pictur repres joseph ride and
mari walk we would see profan in it but a syrian christian
would not i know that hereaft the pictur i first spoke of will look
odd to me

we could not stop to rest two or three hour out from our camp of
cours albeit the brook was besid us so we went on an hour longer
we saw water then but nowher in all the wast around was there a foot
of shade and we were scorch to death like unto the shadow of a
great rock in a weari land  noth in the bibl is more beauti than
that and sure there is no place we have wander to that is abl to
give it such touch express as this blister nake treeless
land

here you do not stop just when you pleas but when you can we found
water but no shade we travel on and found a tree at last but no
water we rest and lunch and came on to this place ain mellahah
the boy call it baldwinsvill it was a veri short day run but the
dragoman doe not want to go further and has invent a plausibl lie
about the countri beyond this be infest by feroci arab who
would make sleep in their midst a danger pastim well they ought
to be danger they carri a rusti old weatherbeaten flintlock gun
with a barrel that is longer than themselv it has no sight on it it
will not carri farther than a brickbat and is not half so certain and
the great sash they wear in mani a fold around their waist has two or
three absurd old horsepistol in it that are rusti from etern disus
weapon that would hang fire just about long enough for you to walk out
of rang and then burst and blow the arab head off exceed
danger these son of the desert are

it use to make my blood run cold to read wm c grime hairbreadth
escap from bedouin but i think i could read them now without a
tremor he never said he was attack by bedouin i believ or was
ever treat uncivilli but then in about everi other chapter he
discov them approach ani how and he had a bloodcurdl fashion
of work up the peril and of wonder how his relat far away
would feel could they see their poor wander boy with his weari feet
and his dim eye in such fear danger and of think for the last
time of the old homestead and the dear old church and the cow and
those thing and of final straighten his form to it utmost height
in the saddl draw his trusti revolv and then dash the spur
into mohammed and sweep down upon the feroci enemi determin to
sell his life as dear as possibl true the bedouin never did ani
thing to him when he arriv and never had ani intent of do ani
thing to him in the first place and wonder what in the mischief he was
make all that todo about but still i could not divest myself of the
idea somehow that a fright peril had been escap through that man
daredevil braveri and so i never could read about wm c grime
bedouin and sleep comfort afterward but i believ the bedouin to
be a fraud now i have seen the monster and i can outrun him i shall
never be afraid of his dare to stand behind his own gun and discharg
it

about fifteen hundr year befor christ this campground of our by
the water of merom was the scene of one of joshua extermin
battl jabin king of hazor up yonder abov dan call all the
sheik about him togeth with their host to make readi for israel
terribl general who was approach

and when all these king were met togeth they came and pitch
togeth by the water of merom to fight against israel and they
went out they and all their host with them much peopl even as
the sand that is upon the seashor for multitud  etc

but joshua fell upon them and utter destroy them root and branch
that was his usual polici in war he never left ani chanc for newspap
controversi about who won the battl he made this valley so quiet
now a reek slaughterpen

somewher in this part of the countryi do not know exact where
israel fought anoth bloodi battl a hundr year later deborah the
prophetess told barak to take ten thousand men and salli forth against
anoth king jabin who had been do someth barak came down from
mount tabor twenti or twentyf mile from here and gave battl to
jabin forc who were in command of sisera barak won the fight and
while he was make the victori complet by the usual method of
extermin the remnant of the defeat host sisera fled away on foot
and when he was near exhaust by fatigu and thirst one jael a woman
he seem to have been acquaint with invit him to come into her tent
and rest himself the weari soldier acced readili enough and jael put
him to bed he said he was veri thirsti and ask his generous
preserv to get him a cup of water she brought him some milk and he
drank of it grate and lay down again to forget in pleasant dream
his lost battl and his humbl pride present when he was asleep she
came soft in with a hammer and drove a hideous tentpen down through
his brain

for he was fast asleep and weari so he die  such is the touch
languag of the bibl the song of deborah and barak prais jael for
the memor servic she had render in an exult strain

bless abov women shall jael the wife of heber the kenit be
bless shall she be abov women in the tent

he ask for water and she gave him milk she brought forth butter
in a lord dish

she put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workman
hammer and with the hammer she smote sisera she smote off his head
when she had pierc and stricken through his templ

at her feet he bow he fell he lay down at her feet he bow
he fell where he bow there he fell down dead 

stir scene like these occur in this valley no more there is not a
solitari villag throughout it whole extentnot for thirti mile in
either direct there are two or three small cluster of bedouin
tent but not a singl perman habit one may ride ten mile
hereabout and not see ten human be

to this region one of the propheci is appli

i will bring the land into desol and your enemi which dwell
therein shall be astonish at it and i will scatter you among the
heathen and i will draw out a sword after you and your land shall
be desol and your citi wast 

no man can stand here by desert ain mellahah and say the propheci has
not been fulfil

in a vers from the bibl which i have quot abov occur the phrase
all these king  it attract my attent in a moment becaus it
carri to my mind such a vast differ signific from what it
alway did at home i can see easili enough that if i wish to profit by
this tour and come to a correct understand of the matter of interest
connect with it i must studious and faith unlearn a great mani
thing i have somehow absorb concern palestin i must begin a
system of reduct like my grape which the spi bore out of the
promis land i have got everi thing in palestin on too larg a scale
some of my idea were wild enough the word palestin alway brought to
my mind a vagu suggest of a countri as larg as the unit state
i do not know whi but such was the case i suppos it was becaus i
could not conceiv of a small countri have so larg a histori i think
i was a littl surpris to find that the grand sultan of turkey was a
man of onli ordinari size i must tri to reduc my idea of palestin to
a more reason shape one get larg impress in boyhood
sometim which he has to fight against all his life all these
king  when i use to read that in sunday school it suggest to me
the sever king of such countri as england franc spain germani
russia etc array in splendid robe ablaz with jewel march in
grave process with sceptr of gold in their hand and flash
crown upon their head but here in ain mellahah after come through
syria and after give serious studi to the charact and custom of the
countri the phrase all these kings lose it grandeur it suggest
onli a parcel of petti chiefsillclad and illcondit savag much
like our indian who live in full sight of each other and whose
kingdoms were larg when they were five mile squar and contain two
thousand soul the combin monarchi of the thirti kings destroy
by joshua on one of his famous campaign onli cover an area about
equal to four of our counti of ordinari size the poor old sheik we
saw at cesarea philippi with his rag band of a hundr follow
would have been call a king in those ancient time

it is seven in the morn and as we are in the countri the grass ought
to be sparkl with dew the flower enrich the air with their
fragranc and the bird sing in the tree but ala there is no dew
here nor flower nor bird nor tree there is a plain and an
unshad lake and beyond them some barren mountain the tent are
tumbl the arab are quarrel like dog and cat as usual the
campground is strewn with packag and bundl the labor of pack them
upon the back of the mule is progress with great activ the
hors are saddl the umbrella are out and in ten minut we shall
mount and the long process will move again the white citi of the
mellahah resurrect for a moment out of the dead centuri will have
disappear again and left no sign




chapter xlvii

we travers some mile of desol countri whose soil is rich enough
but is given over wholli to weedsa silent mourn expans wherein we
saw onli three personsarab with noth on but a long coars shirt
like the towlinen shirt which use to form the onli summer garment of
littl negro boy on southern plantat shepherd they were and they
charm their flock with the tradit shepherd pipea reed
instrument that made music as exquisit infern as these same arab
creat when they sing

in their pipe linger no echo of the wonder music the shepherd
forefath heard in the plain of bethlehem what time the angel sang
peac on earth good will to men 

part of the ground we came over was not ground at all but
rockscreamcolor rock worn smooth as if by water with seldom an
edg or a corner on them but scoop out honeycomb bore out with
eyehol and thus wrought into all manner of quaint shape among
which the uncouth imit of skull was frequent over this part of
the rout were occasion remain of an old roman road like the appian
way whose pavingston still clung to their place with roman
tenac

gray lizard those heir of ruin of sepulchr and desol glide
in and out among the rock or lay still and sun themselv where
prosper has reign and fallen where glori has flame and gone out
where beauti has dwelt and pass away where glad was and sorrow
is where the pomp of life has been and silenc and death brood in it
high place there this reptil make his home and mock at human
vaniti his coat is the color of ash and ash are the symbol of
hope that have perish of aspir that came to nought of love
that are buri if he could speak he would say build templ i will
lord it in their ruin build palac i will inhabit them erect
empir i will inherit them buri your beauti i will watch the worm
at their work and you who stand here and moral over me i will crawl
over your corps at the last

a few ant were in this desert place but mere to spend the summer
they brought their provis from ain mellahaheleven mile

jack is not veri well today it is easi to see but boy as he is he is
too much of a man to speak of it he expos himself to the sun too much
yesterday but sinc it came of his earnest desir to learn and to make
this journey as use as the opportun will allow no one seek to
discourag him by faultfind we miss him an hour from the camp
and then found him some distanc away by the edg of a brook and with
no umbrella to protect him from the fierc sun if he had been use to
go without his umbrella it would have been well enough of cours
but he was not he was just in the act of throw a clod at a
mudturtl which was sun itself on a small log in the brook
we said

dont do that jack what do you want to harm him for what has he
done 

well then i wont kill him but i ought to becaus he is a fraud 

we ask him whi but he said it was no matter we ask him whi onc
or twice as we walk back to the camp but he still said it was no
matter but late at night when he was sit in a thought mood on
the bed we ask him again and he said

well it dont matter i dont mind it now but i did not like it today
you know becaus i dont tell ani thing that isnt so and i dont think
the colonel ought to either but he did he told us at prayer in the
pilgrim tent last night and he seem as if he was read it out of
the bibl too about this countri flow with milk and honey and about
the voic of the turtl be heard in the land i thought that was
draw it a littl strong about the turtl ani how but i ask mr
church if it was so and he said it was and what mr church tell me i
believ but i sat there and watch that turtl near an hour today
and i almost burn up in the sun but i never heard him sing i believ
i sweat a doubl hand of sweati know i didbecaus it got in my
eye and it was run down over my nose all the time and you know my
pant are tighter than ani bodi elsespari foolishnessand the
buckskin seat of them got wet with sweat and then got dri again and
began to draw up and pinch and tear looseit was awfulbut i never
heard him sing final i said this is a fraudthat is what it is it
is a fraudand if i had had ani sens i might have known a curs
mudturtl couldnt sing and then i said i dont wish to be hard on
this fellow and i will just give him ten minut to commenc ten
minut and then if he dont down goe his build but he didnt
commenc you know i had staid there all that time think may be he
might pretti soon becaus he kept on rais his head up and let
it down and draw the skin over his eye for a minut and then
open them out again as if he was tri to studi up someth to
sing but just as the ten minut were up and i was all beat out and
blister he laid his blame head down on a knot and went fast asleep 

it was a littl hard after you had wait so long 

i should think so i said well if you wont sing you shant sleep
ani way and if you fellow had let me alon i would have made him shin
out of galile quicker than ani turtl ever did yet but it isnt ani
matter nowlet it go the skin is all off the back of my neck 

about ten in the morn we halt at joseph pit this is a ruin
khan of the middl age in one of whose side court is a great wall
and arch pit with water in it and this pit one tradit say is the
one joseph brethren cast him into a more authent tradit aid
by the geographi of the countri place the pit in dothan some two day
journey from here howev sinc there are mani who believ in this
present pit as the true one it has it interest

it is hard to make a choic of the most beauti passag in a book which
is so gem with beauti passag as the bibl but it is certain that
not mani thing within it lid may take rank abov the exquisit stori
of joseph who taught those ancient writer their simplic of
languag their felic of express their patho and abov all
their faculti of sink themselv entir out of sight of the reader
and make the narrat stand out alon and seem to tell itself
shakspear is alway present when one read his book macaulay is present
when we follow the march of his state sentenc but the old testament
writer are hidden from view

if the pit i have been speak of is the right one a scene transpir
there long age ago which is familiar to us all in pictur the son
of jacob had been pastur their flock near there their father grew
uneasi at their long absenc and sent joseph his favorit to see if
ani thing had gone wrong with them he travel six or seven day
journey he was onli seventeen year old and boy like he toil
through that long stretch of the vilest rockiest dustiest countri in
asia array in the pride of his heart his beauti clawhamm coat
of mani color joseph was the favorit and that was one crime in the
eye of his brethren he had dream dream and interpret them to
foreshadow his elev far abov all his famili in the far futur and
that was anoth he was dress well and had doubtless display the
harmless vaniti of youth in keep the fact promin befor his
brother these were crime his elder fret over among themselv and
propos to punish when the opportun should offer when they saw him
come up from the sea of galile they recogn him and were glad
they said lo here is this dreamerlet us kill him  but reuben
plead for his life and they spare it but they seiz the boy and
strip the hate coat from his back and push him into the pit they
intend to let him die there but reuben intend to liber him
secret howev while reuben was away for a littl while the
brethren sold joseph to some ishmaelitish merchant who were journey
toward egypt such is the histori of the pit and the selfsam pit is
there in that place even to this day and there it will remain until the
next detach of imagebreak and tomb desecrat arriv from the
quaker citi excurs and they will infal dig it up and carri it
away with them for behold in them is no rever for the solemn
monument of the past and whithersoev they go they destroy and spare
not

joseph becam rich distinguish powerfula the bibl express it
lord over all the land of egypt  joseph was the real king the
strength the brain of the monarchi though pharaoh held the titl
joseph is one of the truli great men of the old testament and he was
the noblest and the manliest save esau whi shall we not say a good
word for the princ bedouin the onli crime that can be brought
against him is that he was unfortun whi must everi bodi prais
joseph greatheart generos to his cruel brethren without stint of
fervent languag and fling onli a reluct bone of prais to esau for
his still sublim generos to the brother who had wrong him jacob
took advantag of esau consum hunger to rob him of his birthright
and the great honor and consider that belong to the posit by
treacheri and falsehood he rob him of his father bless he made
of him a stranger in his home and a wander yet after twenti year
had pass away and jacob met esau and fell at his feet quak with fear
and beg piteous to be spare the punish he knew he deserv
what did that magnific savag do he fell upon his neck and embrac
him when jacobwho was incap of comprehend nobil of
characterstil doubt still fear insist upon find grace
with my lord by the bribe of a present of cattl what did the gorgeous
son of the desert say

nay i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself 

esau found jacob rich belov by wive and children and travel in
state with servant herd of cattl and train of camelsbut he
himself was still the uncourt outcast this brother had made him after
thirteen year of romant mysteri the brethren who had wrong joseph
came stranger in a strang land hungri and humbl to buy a littl
food and be summon to a palac charg with crime they beheld in
it owner their wrong brother they were trembl beggarsh the
lord of a mighti empir what joseph that ever live would have thrown
away such a chanc to show off  who stand firstoutcast esau
forgiv jacob in prosper or joseph on a king throne forgiv the
rag trembler whose happi rascal place him there

just befor we came to joseph pit we had raised a hill and there a
few mile befor us with not a tree or a shrub to interrupt the view
lay a vision which million of worship in the far land of the earth
would give half their possess to seeth sacr sea of galile

therefor we tarri onli a short time at the pit we rest the hors
and ourselv and felt for a few minut the bless shade of the
ancient build we were out of water but the two or three scowl
arab with their long gun who were idl about the place said they
had none and that there was none in the vicin they knew there was a
littl brackish water in the pit but they vener a place made sacr
by their ancestor imprison too much to be will to see christian
dog drink from it but ferguson tie rag and handkerchief togeth
till he made a rope long enough to lower a vessel to the bottom and we
drank and then rode on and in a short time we dismount on those shore
which the feet of the saviour have made holi ground

at noon we took a swim in the sea of galileea bless privileg in this
roast climateand then lunch under a neglect old figtre at the
fountain they call ainettin a hundr yard from ruin capernaum
everi rivulet that gurgl out of the rock and sand of this part of the
world is dub with the titl of fountain  and peopl familiar with
the hudson the great lake and the mississippi fall into transport of
admir over them and exhaust their power of composit in write
their prais if all the poetri and nonsens that have been discharg
upon the fountain and the bland sceneri of this region were collect in
a book it would make a most valuabl volum to burn

dure luncheon the pilgrim enthusiast of our parti who had been so
lightheart and so happi ever sinc they touch holi ground that they
did littl but mutter incoher rhapsodi could scarc eat so
anxious were they to take shipping and sail in veri person upon the
water that had born the vessel of the apostl their anxieti grew
and their excit augment with everi fleet moment until my fear
were arous and i began to have misgiv that in their present
condit they might break reckless loos from all consider of
prudenc and buy a whole fleet of ship to sail in instead of hire a
singl one for an hour as quiet folk are wont to do i trembl to
think of the ruin purs this day perform might result in
i could not help reflect bode upon the intemper zeal with which
middleag men are apt to surfeit themselv upon a seduct folli
which they have tast for the first time and yet i did not feel that
i had a right to be surpris at the state of thing which was give me
so much concern these men had been taught from infanc to rever
almost to worship the holi place whereon their happi eye were rest
now for mani and mani a year this veri pictur had visit their
thought by day and float through their dream by night to stand
befor it in the fleshto see it as they saw it nowto sail upon the
hallow sea and kiss the holi soil that compass it about these were
aspir they had cherish while a generat drag it lag
season by and left it furrow in their face and it frost upon their
hair to look upon this pictur and sail upon this sea they had
forsaken home and it idol and journey thousand and thousand of
mile in weari and tribul what wonder that the sordid light
of workday prudenc should pale befor the glori of a hope like their
in the full splendor of it fruition let them squander million
i saidwho speak of money at a time like this

in this frame of mind i follow as fast as i could the eager footstep
of the pilgrim and stood upon the shore of the lake and swell with
hat and voic the frantic hail they sent after the ship that was
speed by it was a success the toiler of the sea ran in and
beach their barqu joy sat upon everi counten

how much ask him how much ferguson how much to take us alleight
of us and youto bethsaida yonder and to the mouth of jordan and to
the place where the swine ran down into the seaquick and we want to
coast around everi whereeveri where all day long i could sail a
year in these water and tell him well stop at magdala and finish at
tiberia ask him how much ani thingani thing whatev tell him we
dont care what the expens is  i said to myself i knew how it would
be 

ferguson interpret he say two napoleonseight dollar 

one or two counten fell then a paus

too much well give him one 

i never shall know how it wasi shudder yet when i think how the place
is given to miraclesbut in a singl instant of time as it seem to
me that ship was twenti pace from the shore and speed away like a
frighten thing eight crestfallen creatur stood upon the shore and
o to think of it thisthisaft all that overmast ecstaci
oh shame shame end after such unseem boast it was too
much like ho let me at him  follow by a prudent two of you hold
himon can hold me 

instant there was wail and gnash of teeth in the camp the two
napoleon were offeredmor if necessaryand pilgrim and dragoman
shout themselv hoars with plead to the retreat boatmen to
come back but they sail seren away and paid no further heed to
pilgrim who had dream all their live of some day skim over the
sacr water of galile and listen to it hallow stori in the
whisper of it wave and had journey countless leagu to do it
andand then conclud that the fare was too high impertin
mohammedan arab to think such thing of gentlemen of anoth faith

well there was noth to do but just submit and forego the privileg of
voyag on genessaret after come half around the globe to tast that
pleasur there was a time when the saviour taught here that boat
were plenti among the fishermen of the coastsbut boat and fishermen
both are gone now and old josephus had a fleet of menofwar in these
water eighteen centuri agoa hundr and thirti bold canoesbut
they also have pass away and left no sign they battl here no more
by sea and the commerci marin of galile number onli two small
ship just of a pattern with the littl skiff the discipl knew one
was lost to us for goodth other was mile away and far out of hail
so we mount the hors and rode grim on toward magdala canter
along in the edg of the water for want of the mean of pass over it

how the pilgrim abus each other each said it was the other fault
and each in turn deni it no word was spoken by the sinnerseven the
mildest sarcasm might have been danger at such a time sinner that
have been kept down and had exampl held up to them and suffer
frequent lectur and been so put upon in a moral way and in the matter
of go slow and be serious and bottl up slang and so crowd in
regard to the matter of be proper and alway and forev behav
that their live have becom a burden to them would not lag behind
pilgrim at such a time as this and wink furtiv and be joy and
commit other such crimesbecaus it would not occur to them to do it
otherwis they would but they did do it thoughand it did them a
world of good to hear the pilgrim abus each other too we took an
unworthi satisfact in see them fall out now and then becaus it
show that they were onli poor human peopl like us after all

so we all rode down to magdala while the gnash of teeth wax and
wane by turn and harsh word troubl the holi calm of galile

lest ani man think i mean to be illnatur when i talk about our
pilgrim as i have been talk i wish to say in all sincer that i do
not i would not listen to lectur from men i did not like and could
not respect and none of these can say i ever took their lectur
unkind or was restiv under the inflict or fail to tri to profit
by what they said to me they are better men than i am i can say that
honest they are good friend of mine tooand besid if they did
not wish to be stir up occasion in print whi in the mischief did
they travel with me they knew me they knew my liber waythat i
like to give and takewhen it is for me to give and other peopl to
take when one of them threaten to leav me in damascus when i had the
cholera he had no real idea of do iti know his passion natur
and the good impuls that underli it and did i not overhear church
anoth pilgrim say he did not care who went or who staid he would
stand by me till i walk out of damascus on my own feet or was carri
out in a coffin if it was a year and do i not includ church everi
time i abus the pilgrimsand would i be like to speak illnatur
of him i wish to stir them up and make them healthi that is all

we had left capernaum behind us it was onli a shapeless ruin it bore
no semblanc to a town and had noth about it to suggest that it had
ever been a town but all desol and unpeopl as it was it was
illustri ground from it sprang that tree of christian whose broad
arm overshadow so mani distant land today after christ was tempt
of the devil in the desert he came here and began his teach and
dure the three or four year he live afterward this place was his
home almost altogeth he began to heal the sick and his fame soon
spread so wide that suffer came from syria and beyond jordan and
even from jerusalem sever day journey away to be cure of their
diseas here he heal the centurion servant and peter
motherinlaw and multitud of the lame and the blind and person
possess of devil and here also he rais jairus daughter from
the dead he went into a ship with his discipl and when they rous
him from sleep in the midst of a storm he quiet the wind and lull
the troubl sea to rest with his voic he pass over to the other
side a few mile away and reliev two men of devil which pass into
some swine after his return he call matthew from the receipt of
custom perform some cure and creat scandal by eat with
publican and sinner then he went heal and teach through
galile and even journey to tyre and sidon he chose the twelv
discipl and sent them abroad to preach the new gospel he work
miracl in bethsaida and chorazinvillag two or three mile from
capernaum it was near one of them that the miracul draft of fish
is suppos to have been taken and it was in the desert place near the
other that he fed the thousand by the miracl of the loav and
fish he curs them both and capernaum also for not repent
after all the great work he had done in their midst and prophesi
against them they are all in ruin nowwhich is gratifi to the
pilgrim for as usual they fit the etern word of god to the
evanesc thing of this earth christ it is more probabl refer
to the peopl not their shabbi villag of wigwam he said it would be
sad for them at the day of judgmentand what busi have mudhovel
at the day of judgment it would not affect the propheci in the least
it would neither prove it or disprov itif these town were splendid
citi now instead of the almost vanish ruin they are christ visit
magdala which is near by capernaum and he also visit cesarea
philippi he went up to his old home at nazareth and saw his brother
jose and juda and jame and simonthos person who be own
brother to jesus christ one would expect to hear mention sometim
yet who ever saw their name in a newspap or heard them from a pulpit
who ever inquir what manner of youth they were and whether they
slept with jesus play with him and romp about him quarrel with
him concern toy and trifl struck him in anger not suspect
what he was who ever wonder what they thought when they saw him come
back to nazareth a celebr and look long at his unfamiliar face to
make sure and then said it is jesus  who wonder what pass in
their mind when they saw this brother who was onli a brother to them
howev much he might be to other a mysteri stranger who was a god
and had stood face to face with god abov the cloud do strang
miracl with crowd of astonish peopl for wit who wonder if
the brother of jesus ask him to come home with them and said his
mother and his sister were griev at his long absenc and would be
wild with delight to see his face again who ever give a thought to
the sister of jesus at all yet he had sister and memori of them
must have stolen into his mind often when he was illtreat among
stranger when he was homeless and said he had not where to lay his
head when all desert him even peter and he stood alon among his
enemi

christ did few miracl in nazareth and staid but a littl while the
peopl said this the son of god whi his father is noth but a
carpent we know the famili we see them everi day are not his
brother name so and so and his sister so and so and is not his
mother the person they call mari this is absurd  he did not curs his
home but he shook it dust from his feet and went away

capernaum lie close to the edg of the littl sea in a small plain some
five mile long and a mile or two wide which is mild adorn with
oleand which look all the better contrast with the bald hill and
the howl desert which surround them but they are not as deliri
beauti as the book paint them if one be calm and resolut he can
look upon their comeli and live

one of the most astonish thing that have yet fallen under our
observ is the exceed small portion of the earth from which
sprang the now flourish plant of christian the longest journey
our saviour ever perform was from here to jerusalemabout one hundr
to one hundr and twenti mile the next longest was from here to
sidonsay about sixti or seventi mile instead of be wide aparta
american appreci of distanc would natur suggestth place
made most particular celebr by the presenc of christ are near
all right here in full view and within cannonshot of capernaum
leav out two or three short journey of the saviour he spent his
life preach his gospel and perform his miracl within a compass no
larger than an ordinari counti in the unit state it is as much as i
can do to comprehend this stupefi fact how it wear a man out to
have to read up a hundr page of histori everi two or three milesfor
verili the celebr local of palestin occur that close togeth
how wearili how bewild they swarm about your path

in due time we reach the ancient villag of magdala

wherev about the premis there is room for a cat to sit there are
no window to a syrian hut and no chimney when i use to read that
they let a bedridden man down through the roof of a hous in capernaum
to get him into the presenc of the saviour i general had a
threestori brick in my mind and marvel that they did not break his
neck with the strang experi i perceiv now howev that they
might have taken him by the heel and thrown him clear over the hous
without discommod him veri much palestin is not chang ani sinc
those day in manner custom architectur or peopl

as we rode into magdala not a soul was visibl but the ring of the

outold men and old women boy and girl the blind the crazi and the
crippl all in rag soil and scanti raiment and all abject

vagabond did swarm how they show their scar and sore and
piteous point to their maim and crook limb and beg with
their plead eye for chariti we had invok a spirit we could not

infern chorus howajji bucksheesh howajji bucksheesh howajji
bucksheesh bucksheesh bucksheesh  i never was in a storm like that

as we paid the bucksheesh out to soreey children and brown buxom

believ it and so did i i could not well do otherwis with the hous
right there befor my eye as plain as day the pilgrim took down
portion of the front wall for specimen as is their honor custom and
then we depart

we are camp in this place now just within the citi wall of tiberia
we went into the town befor nightfal and look at it peoplew care
noth about it hous it peopl are best examin at a distanc

selfright was their specialti

from various author i have cull inform concern tiberia
it was built by herod antipa the murder of john the baptist and
name after the emperor tiberius it is believ that it stand upon the
site of what must have been age ago a citi of consider
architectur pretens judg by the fine porphyri pillar that are
scatter through tiberia and down the lake shore southward these were
flute onc and yet although the stone is about as hard as iron the
flute are almost worn away these pillar are small and doubtless
the edific they adorn were distinguish more for eleg than
grandeur this modern towntiberiasi onli mention in the new
testament never in the old

the sanhedrim met here last and for three hundr year tiberia was the
metropoli of the jew in palestin it is one of the four holi citi
of the israelit and is to them what mecca is to the mohammedan and
jerusalem to the christian it has been the abid place of mani
learn and famous jewish rabbin they lie buri here and near them
lie also twentyf thousand of their faith who travel far to be near
them while they live and lie with them when they die the great rabbi
ben israel spent three year here in the earli part of the third centuri
he is dead now

the celebr sea of galile is not so larg a sea as lake taho
i measur all lake by taho part becaus i am far more familiar with
it than with ani other and part becaus i have such a high admir
for it and such a world of pleasant recollect of it that it is veri
near imposs for me to speak of lake and not mention it bi a
good dealit is just about twothird as larg and when we come to
speak of beauti this sea is no more to be compar to taho than a
meridian of longitud is to a rainbow the dim water of this pool can
not suggest the limpid brillianc of taho these low shaven yellow
hillock of rock and sand so devoid of perspect can not suggest the
grand peak that compass taho like a wall and whose rib and chasm
front are clad with state pine that seem to grow small and smaller as
they climb till one might fanci them reduc to weed and shrub far
upward where they join the everlast snow silenc and solitud
brood over taho and silenc and solitud brood also over this lake of
genessaret but the solitud of the one is as cheer and fascin
as the solitud of the other is dismal and repel

in the earli morn one watch the silent battl of dawn and dark
upon the water of taho with a placid interest but when the shadow
sulk away and one by one the hidden beauti of the shore unfold
themselv in the full splendor of noon when the still surfac is belt
like a rainbow with broad bar of blue and green and white half the
distanc from circumfer to centr when in the lazi summer
afternoon he lie in a boat far out to where the dead blue of the deep
water begin and smoke the pipe of peac and idl wink at the
distant crag and patch of snow from under his capbrim when the boat
drift shoreward to the white water and he loll over the gunwal and
gaze by the hour down through the crystal depth and note the color of
the pebbl and review the finni armi glide in process a hundr
feet below when at night he see moon and star mountain ridg
feather with pine jut white cape bold promontori grand
sweep of rug sceneri top with bald glimmer peak all
magnific pictur in the polish mirror of the lake in richest
softest detail the tranquil interest that was born with the morn
deepen and deepen by sure degre till it culmin at last in
resistless fascin

it is solitud for bird and squirrel on the shore and fish in the
water are all the creatur that are near to make it otherwis but it is
not the sort of solitud to make one dreari come to galile for that
if these unpeopl desert these rusti mound of barren that never
never never do shake the glare from their harsh outlin and fade and
faint into vagu perspect that melancholi ruin of capernaum this
stupid villag of tiberia slumber under it six funer plume of
palm yonder desol decliv where the swine of the miracl ran down
into the sea and doubtless thought it was better to swallow a devil or
two and get drown into the bargain than have to live longer in such a
place this cloudless blister sky this solemn sailless tintless
lake repos within it rim of yellow hill and low steep bank and
look just as expressionless and unpoet when we leav it sublim
histori out of the question as ani metropolitan reservoir in
christendomif these thing are not food for rock me to sleep mother
none exist i think

but i should not offer the evid for the prosecut and leav the
defens unheard wm c grime depos as follow 

we had taken ship to go over to the other side the sea was not
more than six mile wide of the beauti of the scene howev i
can not say enough nor can i imagin where those travel carri
their eye who have describ the sceneri of the lake as tame or
uninterest the first great characterist of it is the deep
basin in which it lie this is from three to four hundr feet
deep on all side except at the lower end and the sharp slope of
the bank which are all of the richest green is broken and
diversifi by the wadi and watercours which work their way down
through the side of the basin form dark chasm or light sunni
valley near tiberia these bank are rocki and ancient
sepulchr open in them with their door toward the water they
select grand spot as did the egyptian of old for burial
place as if they design that when the voic of god should reach
the sleeper they should walk forth and open their eye on scene
of glorious beauti on the east the wild and desol mountain
contrast fine with the deep blue lake and toward the north
sublim and majest hermon look down on the sea lift his
white crown to heaven with the pride of a hill that has seen the
depart footstep of a hundr generat on the northeast
shore of the sea was a singl tree and this is the onli tree of ani
size visibl from the water of the lake except a few lone palm
in the citi of tiberia and by it solitari posit attract more
attent than would a forest the whole appear of the scene is
precis what we would expect and desir the sceneri of genessaret
to be grand beauti but quiet calm the veri mountain are calm 

it is an ingeni written descript and well calcul to deceiv
but if the paint and the ribbon and the flower be strip from it a
skeleton will be found beneath

so strip there remain a lake six mile wide and neutral in color
with steep green bank unreliev by shrubberi at one end bare
unsight rock with almost invis hole in them of no consequ
to the pictur eastward wild and desol mountain  low desol
hill he should have said in the north a mountain call hermon with
snow on it peculiar of the pictur calm  it promin
featur one tree

no ingenu could make such a pictur beautifulto one actual vision

i claim the right to correct misstat and have so correct the
color of the water in the abov recapitul the water of genessaret
are of an exceed mild blue even from a high elev and a
distanc of five mile close at hand the wit was sail on the
lake it is hard proper to call them blue at all much less deep
blue i wish to state also not as a correct but as matter of
opinion that mount hermon is not a strike or picturesqu mountain by
ani mean be too near the height of it immedi neighbor to be so
that is all i do not object to the wit drag a mountain
fortyf mile to help the sceneri under consider becaus it is
entir proper to do it and besid the pictur need it

c w e  of life in the holi land  depos as follow 

a beauti sea lie unbosom among the galilean hill in the
midst of that land onc possess by zebulon and naphtali asher and
dan the azur of the sky penetr the depth of the lake and
the water are sweet and cool on the west stretch broad fertil
plain on the north the rocki shore rise step by step until in the
far distanc tower the snowi height of hermon on the east through
a misti veil are seen the high plain of perea which stretch away
in rug mountain lead the mind by vari path toward
jerusalem the holi flower bloom in this terrestri paradis
onc beauti and verdant with wave tree sing bird enchant
the ear the turtledov sooth with it soft note the crest
lark send up it song toward heaven and the grave and state
stork inspir the mind with thought and lead it on to medit
and repos life here was onc idyl charm here were onc no
rich no poor no high no low it was a world of eas simplic
and beauti now it is a scene of desol and miseri 

this is not an ingeni pictur it is the worst i ever saw it
describ in elabor detail what it term a terrestri paradis  and
close with the startl inform that this paradis is a scene of
desol and miseri 

i have given two fair averag specimen of the charact of the
testimoni offer by the major of the writer who visit this region
one say of the beauti of the scene i can not say enough  and then
proceed to cover up with a woof of glitter sentenc a thing which
when strip for inspect prove to be onli an unobtrus basin of
water some mountain desol and one tree the other after a
conscienti effort to build a terrestri paradis out of the same
materi with the addit of a grave and state stork  spoil it
all by blunder upon the ghast truth at the last

near everi book concern galile and it lake describ the sceneri
as beauti nonot alway so straightforward as that sometim the
impress intent convey is that it is beauti at the same
time that the author is care not to say that it is in plain saxon
but a care analysi of these descript will show that the materi
of which they are form are not individu beauti and can not be
wrought into combin that are beauti the vener and the
affect which some of these men felt for the scene they were speak
of heat their fanci and bias their judgment but the pleasant
falsiti they wrote were full of honest sincer at ani rate other
wrote as they did becaus they fear it would be unpopular to write
otherwis other were hypocrit and deliber meant to deceiv
ani of them would say in a moment if ask that it was alway right and
alway best to tell the truth they would say that at ani rate if they
did not perceiv the drift of the question

but whi should not the truth be spoken of this region is the truth
harm has it ever need to hide it face god made the sea of
galile and it surround as they are is it the provinc of mr
grime to improv upon the work

i am sure from the tenor of book i have read that mani who have
visit this land in year gone by were presbyterian and came seek
evid in support of their particular creed they found a presbyterian
palestin and they had alreadi made up their mind to find no other
though possibl they did not know it be blind by their zeal
other were baptist seek baptist evid and a baptist palestin
other were cathol methodist episcopalian seek evid
indors their sever creed and a cathol a methodist an
episcopalian palestin honest as these men intent may have been
they were full of partial and prejudic they enter the countri
with their verdict alreadi prepar and they could no more write
dispassion and imparti about it than they could about their own
wive and children our pilgrim have brought their verdict with them
they have shown it in their convers ever sinc we left beirout
i can almost tell in set phrase what they will say when they see tabor
nazareth jericho and jerusalembecaus i have the book they will
smouch their idea from these author write pictur and frame
rhapsodi and lesser men follow and see with the author eye instead
of their own and speak with his tongu what the pilgrim said at
cesarea philippi surpris me with it wisdom i found it afterward in
robinson what they said when genessaret burst upon their vision
charm me with it grace i find it in mr thompson land and the
book  they have spoken often in happili word languag which never
vari of how they mean to lay their weari head upon a stone at bethel
as jacob did and close their dim eye and dream perchanc of angel
descend out of heaven on a ladder it was veri pretti but i have
recogn the weari head and the dim eye final they borrow the
ideaand the wordsand the constructionand the punctuationfrom
grime the pilgrim will tell of palestin when they get home not as
it appear to them but as it appear to thompson and robinson and
grimeswith the tint vari to suit each pilgrim creed

pilgrim sinner and arab are all abe now and the camp is still
labor in loneli is irksom sinc i made my last few note i have
been sit outsid the tent for half an hour night is the time to see
galile genessaret under these lustrous star has noth repuls
about it genessaret with the glitter reflect of the
constel fleck it surfac almost make me regret that i ever
saw the rude glare of the day upon it it histori and it associ
are it chiefest charm in ani eye and the spell they weav are feebl
in the search light of the sun then we scarc feel the fetter
our thought wander constant to the practic concern of life and
refus to dwell upon thing that seem vagu and unreal but when the day
is done even the most unimpress must yield to the dreami influenc
of this tranquil starlight the old tradit of the place steal upon
his memori and haunt his reveri and then his fanci cloth all sight
and sound with the supernatur in the lap of the wave upon the
beach he hear the dip of ghost oar in the secret nois of the
night he hear spirit voic in the soft sweep of the breez the rush
of invis wing phantom ship are on the sea the dead of twenti
centuri come forth from the tomb and in the dirg of the night wind
the song of old forgotten age find utter again

in the starlight galile has no boundari but the broad compass of the
heaven and is a theatr meet for great event meet for the birth of a
religion abl to save a world and meet for the state figur appoint
to stand upon it stage and proclaim it high decre but in the
sunlight one say is it for the deed which were done and the word
which were spoken in this littl acr of rock and sand eighteen
centuri gone that the bell are ring today in the remot island
of the sea and far and wide over contin that clasp the circumfer
of the huge globe

one can comprehend it onli when night has hidden all incongru and
creat a theatr proper for so grand a drama




chapter xlix

we took anoth swim in the sea of galile at twilight yesterday and
anoth at sunris this morn we have not sail but three swim are
equal to a sail are they not there were plenti of fish visibl in the
water but we have no outsid aid in this pilgrimag but tent life in
the holi land  the land and the book  and other literatur of like
descriptionno fishingtackl there were no fish to be had in the
villag of tiberia true we saw two or three vagabond mend their
net but never tri to catch ani thing with them

we did not go to the ancient warm bath two mile below tiberia i had
no desir in the world to go there this seem a littl strang and
prompt me to tri to discov what the caus of this unreason
indiffer was it turn out to be simpli becaus plini mention
them i have conceiv a sort of unwarrant unfriendli toward
plini and st paul becaus it seem as if i can never ferret out a place
that i can have to myself it alway and etern transpir that st
paul has been to that place and plini has mentioned it

in the earli morn we mount and start and then a weird apparit
march forth at the head of the processiona pirat i thought if ever
a pirat dwelt upon land it was a tall arab as swarthi as an indian
youngsay thirti year of age on his head he had close bound a
gorgeous yellow and red stripe silk scarf whose end lavish fring
with tassel hung down between his shoulder and dalli with the wind
from his neck to his knee in ampl fold a robe swept down that was a
veri starspangl banner of curv and sinuous bar of black and white
out of his back somewher appar the long stem of a chibouk
project and reach far abov his right shoulder athwart his back
diagon and extend high abov his left shoulder was an arab gum
of saladin time that was splendid with silver plate from stock clear
up to the end of it measureless stretch of barrel about his waist was
bound mani and mani a yard of elabor figur but sad tarnish
stuff that came from sumptuous persia and among the baggi fold in front
the sunbeam glint from a formid batteri of old brassmount
horsepistol and the gild hilt of bloodthirsti knive there were
holster for more pistol append to the wonder stack of longhair
goatskin and persian carpet which the man had been taught to regard
in the light of a saddl and down among the pendul rank of vast
tassel that swung from that saddl and clang against the iron shovel
of a stirrup that prop the warrior knee up toward his chin was a
crook silverclad scimitar of such aw dimens and such
implac express that no man might hope to look upon it and not
shudder the fring and bedizen princ whose privileg it is to ride
the poni and lead the eleph into a countri villag is poor and nake
compar to this chao of paraphernalia and the happi vaniti of the one

then hire a regiment would you send us out among these desper

the dragoman laughednot at the faceti of the simil for verili
that guid or that courier or that dragoman never yet live upon earth
who had in him the faintest appreci of a joke even though that joke
were so broad and so ponder that if it fell on him it would flatten
him out like a postag stampth dragoman laugh and then embolden
by some thought that was in his brain no doubt proceed to extrem
and wink

in strait like these when a man laugh it is encourag when he
wink it is posit reassur he final intim that one guard
would be suffici to protect us but that that one was an absolut
necess it was becaus of the moral weight his aw panopli would
have with the bedouin then i said we didnt want ani guard at all
if one fantast vagabond could protect eight arm christian and a pack
of arab servant from all harm sure that detach could protect
themselv he shook his head doubt then i said just think of
how it looksthink of how it would read to selfreli american that
we went sneak through this desert wilder under the protect of
this masquerad arab who would break his neck get out of the
countri if a man that was a man ever start after him it was a mean
low degrad posit whi were we ever told to bring navi revolv

fell at the differ ford and passag of the jordan that day 

we jog along peac over the great caravan rout from damascus to
jerusalem and egypt past lubia and other syrian hamlet perch in the
unvari style upon the summit of steep mound and hill and fenc
round about with giant cactus the sign of worthless land with
prick pear upon them like ham and came at last to the battlefield
of hattin

it is a grand irregular plateau and look as if it might have been
creat for a battlefield here the peerless saladin met the christian
host some seven hundr year ago and broke their power in palestin for
all time to come there had long been a truce between the oppos
forc but accord to the guidebook raynauld of chatillon lord of
kerak broke it by plunder a damascus caravan and refus to give up
either the merchant or their good when saladin demand them this
conduct of an insol petti chieftain stung the sultan to the quick and
he swore that he would slaughter raynauld with his own hand no matter
how or when or where he found him both armi prepar for war
under the weak king of jerusalem was the veri flower of the christian
chivalri he foolish compel them to undergo a long exhaust
march in the scorch sun and then without water or other
refresh order them to encamp in this open plain the splendid
mount mass of moslem soldier swept round the north end of
genessaret burn and destroy as they came and pitch their camp
in front of the oppos line at dawn the terrif fight began
surround on all side by the sultan swarm battalion the
christian knight fought on without a hope for their live they fought
with desper valor but to no purpos the odd of heat and number
and consum thirst were too great against them toward the middl of
the day the bravest of their band cut their way through the moslem rank
and gain the summit of a littl hill and there hour after hour they
close around the banner of the cross and beat back the charg
squadron of the enemi

but the doom of the christian power was seal sunset found saladin
lord of palestin the christian chivalri strewn in heap upon the field
and the king of jerusalem the grand master of the templar and raynauld
of chatillon captiv in the sultan tent saladin treat two of the
prison with princ courtesi and order refresh to be set
befor them when the king hand an ice sherbet to chatillon the
sultan said  it is thou that givest it to him not i  he rememb
his oath and slaughter the hapless knight of chatillon with his own
hand

it was hard to realiz that this silent plain had onc resound with
martial music and trembl to the tramp of arm men it was hard to
peopl this solitud with rush column of cavalri and stir it torpid
puls with the shout of victor the shriek of the wound and the
flash of banner and steel abov the surg billow of war a desol
is here that not even imagin can grace with the pomp of life and

we reach tabor safe and consider in advanc of that old
ironclad swindl of a guard we never saw a human be on the whole

lord the count pallavicini near genoa you go wander for hour among

where you expect them not loiter through batter mediaev castl
in miniatur that seem hoari with age and yet were built a dozen year
ago medit over ancient crumbl tomb whose marbl column were
mar and broken purpos by the modern artist that made them
stumbl unawar upon toy palac wrought of rare and cost

would never suggest that it was made so to order sweep round and
round in the midst of a forest on an enchant wooden hors that is move
by some invis agenc travers roman road and pass under

discharg jet of water on you from everi possibl direct and where
even the flower you touch assail you with a shower boat on a
subterranean lake among cavern and arch royal drape with cluster
stalactit and pass out into open day upon anoth lake which is
border with slope bank of grass and gay with patrician barg that
swim at anchor in the shadow of a miniatur marbl templ that rise out
of the clear water and glass it white statu it rich capit and
flute column in the tranquil depth so from marvel to marvel you
have drift on think all the time that the one last seen must be the
chiefest and verili the chiefest wonder is reserv until the last
but you do not see it until you step ashor and pass through a
wilder of rare flower collect from everi corner of the earth you
stand at the door of one more mimic templ right in this place the
artist tax his genius to the utmost and fair open the gate of
fairi land you look through an unpretend pane of glass stain
yellowth first thing you see is a mass of quiver foliag ten short
step befor you in the midst of which is a rag open like a
gatewaya thing that is common enough in natur and not apt to excit
suspicion of a deep human designand abov the bottom of the gateway
project in the most careless way a few broad tropic leav and
brilliant flower all of a sudden through this bright bold gateway
you catch a glimps of the faintest softest richest pictur that ever
grace the dream of a die saint sinc john saw the new jerusalem
glimmer abov the cloud of heaven a broad sweep of sea fleck
with careen sail a sharp jut cape and a lofti lighthous on
it a slope lawn behind it beyond a portion of the old citi of
palac  with it park and hill and state mansion beyond these a
prodigi mountain with it strong outlin sharpli cut against ocean
and sky and over all vagrant shred and flake of cloud float in a
sea of gold the ocean is gold the citi is gold the meadow the
mountain the skyeveri thing is goldenrich and mellow and dreami as
a vision of paradis no artist could put upon canva it entranc
beauti and yet without the yellow glass and the care contriv
accid of a framework that cast it into enchant distanc and shut out
from it all unattract featur it was not a pictur to fall into
ecstasi over such is life and the trail of the serpent is over us
all

there is noth for it now but to come back to old tabor though the
subject is tiresom enough and i can not stick to it for wander off
to scene that are pleasant to rememb i think i will skip ani how
there is noth about tabor except we conced that it was the scene of
the transfigur but some gray old ruin stack up there in all
age of the world from the day of stout gideon and parti that
flourish thirti centuri ago to the fresh yesterday of crusad
time it has it greek convent and the coffe there is good but never
a splinter of the true cross or bone of a hallow saint to arrest the
idl thought of worldl and turn them into graver channel
a cathol church is noth to me that has no relic

the plain of esdraelonth battlefield of the nationson set one
to dream of joshua and benhadad and saul and gideon tamerlan
tancr coeur de lion and saladin the warrior king of persia egypt
hero and napoleonfor they all fought here if the magic of the
moonlight could summon from the grave of forgotten centuri and mani
land the countless myriad that have battl on this wide farreach
floor and array them in the thousand strang costum of their hundr
nation and send the vast host sweep down the plain splendid
with plume and banner and glitter lanc i could stay here an age
to see the phantom pageant but the magic of the moonlight is a vaniti
and a fraud and whoso putteth his trust in it shall suffer sorrow and
disappoint

down at the foot of tabor and just at the edg of the stori plain of
esdraelon is the insignific villag of deburieh where deborah
prophetess of israel live it is just like magdala




chapter l

we descend from mount tabor cross a deep ravin follow a hilli
rocki road to nazarethdist two hour all distanc in the east are
measur by hour not mile a good hors will walk three mile an hour
over near ani kind of a road therefor an hour here alway stand
for three mile this method of comput is bothersom and annoy
and until one get thorough accustom to it it carri no
intellig to his mind until he has stop and translat the pagan
hour into christian mile just as peopl do with the spoken word of a
foreign languag they are acquaint with but not familiar enough to
catch the mean in a moment distanc travel by human feet are also
estim by hour and minut though i do not know what the base of the
calcul is in constantinopl you ask how far is it to the
consul  and they answer about ten minut  how far is it to the
lloyd agenc  quarter of an hour  how far is it to the lower
bridg  four minut  i can not be posit about it but i think
that there when a man order a pair of pantaloon he say he want them
a quarter of a minut in the leg and nine second around the waist

two hour from tabor to nazarethand as it was an uncommon narrow
crook trail we necessarili met all the camel train and jackass
caravan between jericho and jacksonvill in that particular place and
nowher els the donkey do not matter so much becaus they are so
small that you can jump your hors over them if he is an anim of
spirit but a camel is not jumpabl a camel is as tall as ani ordinari
dwellinghous in syriawhich is to say a camel is from one to two and
sometim near three feet taller than a goodsiz man in this part
of the countri his load is oftenest in the shape of coloss sackson
on each side he and his cargo take up as much room as a carriag
think of meet this style of obstruct in a narrow trail the camel
would not turn out for a king he stalk seren along bring his
cushion stilt forward with the long regular swing of a pendulum and
whatev is in the way must get out of the way peaceabl or be wipe out
forcibl by the bulki sack it was a tiresom ride to us and perfect
exhaust to the hors we were compel to jump over upward of
eighteen hundr donkey and onli one person in the parti was unseat
less than sixti time by the camel this seem like a power
statement but the poet has said thing are not what they seem  i can
not think of ani thing now more certain to make one shudder than to
have a softfoot camel sneak up behind him and touch him on the ear
with it cold flabbi underlip a camel did this for one of the boy
who was droop over his saddl in a brown studi he glanc up and saw
the majest apparit hover abov him and made frantic effort to
get out of the way but the camel reach out and bit him on the shoulder
befor he accomplish it this was the onli pleasant incid of the
journey

at nazareth we camp in an oliv grove near the virgin mari fountain
and that wonder arab guard came to collect some bucksheesh for his
services in follow us from tiberia and ward off invis
danger with the terror of his armament the dragoman had paid his
master but that count as nothingif you hire a man to sneez for you
here and anoth man choos to help him you have got to pay both
they do noth whatev without pay how it must have surpris these
peopl to hear the way of salvat offer to them without money and
without price  if the manner the peopl or the custom of this
countri have chang sinc the saviour time the figur and metaphor
of the bibl are not the evid to prove it by

we enter the great latin convent which is built over the tradit
dwellingplac of the holi famili we went down a flight of fifteen
step below the ground level and stood in a small chapel trick out
with tapestri hang silver lamp and oil paint a spot mark
by a cross in the marbl floor under the altar was exhibit as the
place made forev holi by the feet of the virgin when she stood up to
receiv the messag of the angel so simpl so unpretend a local
to be the scene of so mighti an event the veri scene of the
annunciationan event which has been commemor by splendid shrine
and august templ all over the civil world and one which the
princ of art have made it their loftiest ambit to pictur worthili
on their canva a spot whose histori is familiar to the veri children of
everi hous and citi and obscur hamlet of the furthest land of
christendom a spot which myriad of men would toil across the breadth of
a world to see would consid it a priceless privileg to look upon
it was easi to think these thought but it was not easi to bring myself
up to the magnitud of the situat i could sit off sever thousand
mile and imagin the angel appear with shadowi wing and lustrous
counten and note the glori that stream downward upon the virgin
head while the messag from the throne of god fell upon her earsani one
can do that beyond the ocean but few can do it here i saw the littl
recess from which the angel step but could not fill it void the
angel that i know are creatur of unstabl fancythey will not fit in
nich of substanti stone imagin labor best in distant field
i doubt if ani man can stand in the grotto of the annunci and peopl
with the phantom imag of his mind it too tangibl wall of stone

they show us a broken granit pillar depend from the roof which
they said was hack in two by the moslem conqueror of nazareth in the
vain hope of pull down the sanctuari but the pillar remain
miracul suspend in the air and unsupport itself support
then and still support the roof by divid this statement up among
eight it was found not difficult to believ it

these gift latin monk never do ani thing by halv if they were to
show you the brazen serpent that was elev in the wilder you
could depend upon it that they had on hand the pole it was elev on
also and even the hole it stood in they have got the grotto of the
annunci here and just as conveni to it as one throat is to his
mouth they have also the virgin kitchen and even her sittingroom
where she and joseph watch the infant saviour play with hebrew toy
eighteen hundr year ago all under one roof and all clean spacious
comfort grotto  it seem curious that personag intim
connect with the holi famili alway live in grottoesin nazareth in
bethlehem in imperi ephesusand yet nobodi els in their day and
generat thought of do ani thing of the kind if they ever did
their grotto are all gone and i suppos we ought to wonder at the
peculiar marvel of the preserv of these i speak of when the virgin
fled from herod wrath she hid in a grotto in bethlehem and the same
is there to this day the slaughter of the innoc in bethlehem was
done in a grotto the saviour was born in a grottoboth are shown to
pilgrim yet it is exceed strang that these tremend event all
happen in grottoesand exceed fortun likewis becaus the
strongest hous must crumbl to ruin in time but a grotto in the live
rock will last forev it is an imposturethi grotto stuffbut it is
one that all men ought to thank the cathol for wherev they ferret
out a lost local made holi by some scriptur event they straightway
build a massivealmost imperishablechurch there and preserv the
memori of that local for the gratif of futur generat if
it had been left to protest to do this most worthi work we would not
even know where jerusalem is today and the man who could go and put his
finger on nazareth would be too wise for this world the world owe the
cathol it good will even for the happi rascal of hew out these
bogus grotto in the rock for it is infinit more satisfactori to
look at a grotto where peopl have faith believ for centuri
that the virgin onc live than to have to imagin a dwellingplac for
her somewher ani where nowher loos and at larg all over this town
of nazareth there is too larg a scope of countri the imagin can
not work there is no one particular spot to chain your eye rivet your
interest and make you think the memori of the pilgrim can not perish
while plymouth rock remain to us the old monk are wise they know
how to drive a stake through a pleasant tradit that will hold it to
it place forev

we visit the place where jesus work for fifteen year as a
carpent and where he attempt to teach in the synagogu and was
driven out by a mob cathol chapel stand upon these site and protect
the littl fragment of the ancient wall which remain our pilgrim
broke off specimen we visit also a new chapel in the midst of the
town which is built around a boulder some twelv feet long by four feet
thick the priest discov a few year ago that the discipl had
sat upon this rock to rest onc when they had walk up from capernaum
they hasten to preserv the relic relic are veri good properti
travel are expect to pay for see them and they do it cheer
we like the idea one conscienc can never be the wors for the
knowledg that he has paid his way like a man our pilgrim would have
like veri well to get out their lampblack and stencilpl and paint
their name on that rock togeth with the name of the villag they
hail from in america but the priest permit noth of that kind
to speak the strict truth howev our parti seldom offend in that way
though we have men in the ship who never lose an opportun to do it
our pilgrim chief sin is their lust for specimen  i suppos that by
this time they know the dimens of that rock to an inch and it
weight to a ton and i do not hesit to charg that they will go back
there tonight and tri to carri it off

this fountain of the virgin is the one which tradit say mari use
to get water from twenti time a day when she was a girl and bear it
away in a jar upon her head the water stream through faucet in the
face of a wall of ancient masonri which stand remov from the hous of
the villag the young girl of nazareth still collect about it by the
dozen and keep up a riotous laughter and skylark the nazaren girl
are home some of them have larg lustrous eye but none of them
have pretti face these girl wear a singl garment usual and it is
loos shapeless of undecid color it is general out of repair too
they wear from crown to jaw curious string of old coin after the
manner of the bell of tiberia and brass jewelri upon their wrist and
in their ear they wear no shoe and stock they are the most
human girl we have found in the countri yet and the best natur
but there is no question that these picturesqu maiden sad lack
comeli

a pilgrimth enthusiastsaid see that tall grace girl look at
the madonnalik beauti of her counten 

anoth pilgrim came along present and said observ that tall
grace girl what queen madonnalik grace of beauti is in her
counten 

i said she is not tall she is short she is not beauti she is
home she is grace enough i grant but she is rather boister 

the third and last pilgrim move by befor long and he said ah what
a tall grace girl what madonnalik grace of queen beauti 

the verdict were all in it was time now to look up the author
for all these opinion i found this paragraph which follow written
by whom wm c grime

after we were in the saddl we rode down to the spring to have a
last look at the women of nazareth who were as a class much the
prettiest that we had seen in the east as we approach the crowd
a tall girl of nineteen advanc toward miriam and offer her a cup
of water her movement was grace and queen we exclaim on
the spot at the madonnalik beauti of her counten white was
sudden thirsti and beg for water and drank it slowli with
his eye over the top of the cup fix on her larg black eye
which gaze on him quit as curious as he on her then moreright
want water she gave it to him and he manag to spill it so as
to ask for anoth cup and by the time she came to me she saw
through the oper her eye were full of fun as she look at
me i laugh outright and she join me in as gay a shout as ever
countri maiden in old orang counti i wish for a pictur of her
a madonna whose face was a portrait of that beauti nazareth
girl would be a thing of beauti and a joy forev 

that is the kind of gruel which has been serv out from palestin for
age commend me to fennimor cooper to find beauti in the indian and
to grime to find it in the arab arab men are often fine look but
arab women are not we can all believ that the virgin mari was
beauti it is not natur to think otherwis but doe it follow that
it is our duti to find beauti in these present women of nazareth

i love to quot from grime becaus he is so dramat and becaus he
is so romant and becaus he seem to care but littl whether he tell
the truth or not so he scare the reader or excit his envi or his
admir

he went through this peac land with one hand forev on his revolv
and the other on his pockethandkerchief alway when he was not on the
point of cri over a holi place he was on the point of kill an
arab more surpris thing happen to him in palestin than ever

tent at dead of night and shot at what he took to be an arab lie on a
rock some distanc away plan evil the ball kill a wolf just
befor he fire he make a dramat pictur of himselfa usual to
scare the reader

the rock if it were a man whi did he not now drop me he had a
beauti shot as i stood out in my black boornoos against the
white tent i had the sensat of an enter bullet in my throat

pistol and loosen them quiet in our shawl  etc alway cool

in samaria he charg up a hill in the face of a volley of stone he
fire into the crowd of men who threw them he say

i never lost an opportun of impress the arab with the
perfect of american and english weapon and the danger of
attack ani one of the arm frank i think the lesson of that
ball not lost 

at beit jin he gave his whole band of arab mulet a piec of his mind
and then

i content myself with a solemn assur that if there occur
anoth instanc of disobedi to order i would thrash the
respons parti as he never dream of be thrash and if i
could not find who was respons i would whip them all from
first to last whether there was a governor at hand to do it or i
had to do it myself

perfect fearless this man

he rode down the perpendicular path in the rock from the castl of
bania to the oak grove at a fli gallop his hors stride thirti
feet at everi bound i stand prepar to bring thirti reliabl
wit to prove that putnam famous feat at horseneck was
insignific compar to this

behold himalway theatricallook at jerusalemthi time by an
oversight with his hand off his pistol for onc

i stood in the road my hand on my hors neck and with my dim
eye sought to trace the outlin of the holi place which i had
long befor fix in my mind but the fastflow tear forbad my
succeed there were our mohammedan servant a latin monk two
armenian and a jew in our corteg and all alik gaze with
overflow eye 

if latin monk and arab cri i know to a moral certainti that the
hors cri also and so the pictur is complet

but when necess demand he could be firm as adam in the lebanon
valley an arab youtha christian he is particular to explain that
mohammedan do not stealrob him of a paltri ten dollar worth of
powder and shot he convict him befor a sheik and look on while he
was punish by the terribl bastinado hear him

he mousa was on his back in a twinkl howl shout
scream but he was carri out to the piazza befor the door
where we could see the oper and laid face down one man sat
on his back and one on his leg the latter hold up his feet
while a third laid on the bare sole a rhinoceroshid koorbash

been loudest in his denunci that morningbesought the howajji
to have merci on the fellow

mohammedan sheik should deem proper

as i mount yusef onc more beg me to interfer and have merci
on them but i look around at the dark face of the crowd and i
couldnt find one drop of piti in my heart for them 

he close his pictur with a rollick burst of humor which contrast
fine with the grief of the mother and her children

then onc more i bow my head it is no shame to have wept in
palestin i wept when i saw jerusalem i wept when i lay in the
starlight at bethlehem i wept on the bless shore of galile

the trigger of my pistol when i rode with it in my right hand along
the shore of the blue sea weep mi eye was not dim by
those tear nor my heart in aught weaken let him who would sneer
at my emot close this volum here for he will find littl to his

chapter li

nazareth is wonder interest becaus the town has an air about it
of be precis as jesus left it and one find himself say all
the time the boy jesus has stood in this doorwayha play in that
streetha touch these stone with his handsha rambl over these
chalki hill  whoever shall write the boyhood of jesus ingeni will
make a book which will possess a vivid interest for young and old alik
i judg so from the greater interest we found in nazareth than ani of our
specul upon capernaum and the sea of galile gave rise to it was
not possibl stand by the sea of galile to frame more than a vagu
faraway idea of the majest personag who walk upon the crest wave
as if they had been solid earth and who touch the dead and they rose
up and spoke i read among my note now with a new interest some
sentenc from an edit of  of the apocryph new testament
extract 

christ kiss by a bride made dumb by sorcer cure her a
leprous girl cure by the water in which the infant christ was
wash and becom the servant of joseph and mari the leprous son
of a princ cure in like manner

a young man who had been bewitch and turn into a mule
miracul cure by the infant savior be put on his back and
is marri to the girl who had been cure of leprosi whereupon the
bystand prais god

chapter  christ miracul widen or contract gate
milkpail siev or box not proper made by joseph he not
be skill at his carpent trade the king of jerusalem
give joseph an order for a throne joseph work on it for two
year and make it two span too short the king be angri with
him jesus comfort himcommand him to pull one side of the
throne while he pull the other and bring it to it proper
dimens

chapter  jesus charg with throw a boy from the roof of a
hous miracul caus the dead boy to speak and acquit him
fetch water for his mother break the pitcher and miracul
gather the water in his mantl and bring it home

sent to a schoolmast refus to tell his letter and the
schoolmast go to whip him his hand wither 

further on in this quaint volum of reject gospel is an epistl of st
clement to the corinthian which was use in the church and consid
genuin fourteen or fifteen hundr year ago in it this account of the
fabl phoenix occur

 let us consid that wonder type of the resurrect which
is seen in the eastern countri that is to say in arabia

 there is a certain bird call a phoenix of this there is
never but one at a time and that live five hundr year and
when the time of it dissolut draw near that it must die it
make itself a nest of frankincens and myrrh and other spice
into which when it time is fulfil it enter and die

 but it flesh putrefi breed a certain worm which be
nourish by the juic of the dead bird bring forth feather and
when it is grown to a perfect state it take up the nest in which
the bone of it parent lie and carri it from arabia into egypt
to a citi call heliopoli

 and fli in open day in the sight of all men lay it upon
the altar of the sun and so return from whenc it came

 the priest then search into the record of the time and find
that it return precis at the end of five hundr year 

busi is busi and there is noth like punctual especi
in a phoenix

the few chapter relat to the infanc of the saviour contain mani
thing which seem frivol and not worth preserv a larg part of
the remain portion of the book read like good scriptur howev
there is one vers that ought not to have been reject becaus it so
evid prophet refer to the general run of congress of the
unit state

 they carri themselv high and as prudent men and though
they are fool yet would seem to be teacher 

i have set these extract down as i found them everywher among the
cathedr of franc and itali one find tradit of personag that
do not figur in the bibl and of miracl that are not mention in it
page but they are all in this apocryph new testament and though
they have been rule out of our modern bibl it is claim that they
were accept gospel twelv or fifteen centuri ago and rank as high
in credit as ani one need to read this book befor he visit those
vener cathedr with their treasur of taboo and forgotten
tradit

they impos anoth pirat upon us at nazarethanoth invinc arab
guard we took our last look at the citi cling like a whitewash
wasp nest to the hillsid and at eight oclock in the morn
depart we dismount and drove the hors down a bridlepath which i
think was fulli as crook as a corkscrew which i know to be as steep as
the downward sweep of a rainbow and which i believ to be the worst
piec of road in the geographi except one in the sandwich island which
i rememb pain and possibl one or two mountain trail in the
sierra nevada often in this narrow path the hors had to pois
himself nice on a rude stone step and then drop his forefeet over the
edg and down someth more than half his own height this brought his
nose near the ground while his tail point up toward the sky somewher
and gave him the appear of prepar to stand on his head a hors
cannot look dignifi in this posit we accomplish the long descent
at last and trot across the great plain of esdraelon

some of us will be shot befor we finish this pilgrimag the pilgrim
read nomad life and keep themselv in a constant state of quixot
heroism they have their hand on their pistol all the time and everi
now and then when you least expect it they snatch them out and take aim
at bedouin who are not visibl and draw their knive and make savag
pass at other bedouin who do not exist i am in dead peril alway
for these spasm are sudden and irregular and of cours i cannot tell
when to be get out of the way if i am accident murder some
time dure one of these romant frenzi of the pilgrim mr grime
must be rigid held to answer as an accessori befor the fact if the
pilgrim would take deliber aim and shoot at a man it would be all
right and properbecaus that man would not be in ani danger but these
random assault are what i object to i do not wish to see ani more
place like esdraelon where the ground is level and peopl can gallop
it put melodramat nonsens into the pilgrim head all at onc
when one is jog along stupid in the sun and think about
someth ever so far away here they come at a stormi gallop spur
and whoop at those ridgi old soreback plug till their heel fli
higher than their head and as they whiz by out come a littl
potatogun of a revolv there is a startl littl pop and a small pellet
goe sing through the air now that i have begun this pilgrimag i
intend to go through with it though sooth to say noth but the most
desper valor has kept me to my purpos up to the present time i do
not mind bedouin i am not afraid of them becaus neither bedouin nor
ordinari arab have shown ani disposit to harm us but i do feel
afraid of my own comrad

arriv at the furthest verg of the plain we rode a littl way up a
hill and found ourselv at endor famous for it witch her descend
are there yet they were the wildest hord of halfnak savag we have
found thus far they swarm out of mud beehiv out of hovel of the
drygood box pattern out of gape cave under shelv rock out of
crevic in the earth in five minut the dead solitud and silenc of
the place were no more and a beg screech shout mob were
struggl about the hors feet and block the way bucksheesh
bucksheesh bucksheesh howajji bucksheesh  it was magdala over
again onli here the glare from the infidel eye was fierc and full of
hate the popul number two hundr and fifti and more than half
the citizen live in cave in the rock dirt degrad and savageri
are endor specialti we say no more about magdala and deburieh now
endor head the list it is wors than ani indian campoodi the hill
is barren rocki and forbid no sprig of grass is visibl and onli
one tree this is a figtre which maintain a precari foot among
the rock at the mouth of the dismal cavern onc occupi by the
verit witch of endor in this cavern tradit say saul the
king sat at midnight and stare and trembl while the earth shook
the thunder crash among the hill and out of the midst of fire and
smoke the spirit of the dead prophet rose up and confront him saul
had crept to this place in the dark while his armi slept to learn
what fate await him in the morrow battl he went away a sad man to
meet disgrac and death

a spring trickl out of the rock in the gloomi recess of the cavern
and we were thirsti the citizen of endor object to our go in
there they do not mind dirt they do not mind rag they do not mind
vermin they do not mind barbar ignor and savageri they do not
mind a reason degre of starvat but they do like to be pure and
holi befor their god whoever he may be and therefor they shudder and
grow almost pale at the idea of christian lip pollut a spring whose
water must descend into their sanctifi gullet we had no wanton
desir to wound even their feel or trampl upon their prejudic but
we were out of water thus earli in the day and were burn up with
thirst it was at this time and under these circumst that i
frame an aphor which has alreadi becom celebr i said
necess know no law  we went in and drank

we got away from the noisi wretch final drop them in squad and
coupl as we file over the hillsth age first the infant next the
young girl further on the strong men ran besid us a mile and onli
left when they had secur the last possibl piastr in the way of
bucksheesh

in an hour we reach nain where christ rais the widow son to life
nain is magdala on a small scale it has no popul of ani
consequ within a hundr yard of it is the origin graveyard for
aught i know the tombston lie flat on the ground which is jewish
fashion in syria i believ the moslem do not allow them to have
upright tombston a moslem grave is usual rough plaster over and
whitewash and has at one end an upright project which is shape
into exceed rude attempt at ornament in the citi there is
often no appear of a grave at all a tall slender marbl tombston
elabor lettr gild and paint mark the burial place and this
is surmount by a turban so carv and shape as to signifi the dead
man rank in life

they show a fragment of ancient wall which they said was one side of
the gate out of which the widow dead son was be brought so mani
centuri ago when jesus met the process

now when he came nigh to the gate of the citi behold there was a
dead man carri out the onli son of his mother and she was a
widow and much peopl of the citi was with her

and when the lord saw her he had compass on her and said weep
not

and he came and touch the bier and they that bare him stood
still and he said young man i say unto thee aris

and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he deliv
him to his mother

and there came a fear on all and they glorifi god say that
a great prophet is risen up among us and that god hath visit his
peopl 

a littl mosqu stand upon the spot which tradit say was occupi by
the widow dwell two or three age arab sat about it door we
enter and the pilgrim broke specimen from the foundat wall
though they had to touch and even step upon the pray carpets to do
it it was almost the same as break piec from the heart of those
old arab to step rude upon the sacr pray mat with boot
feeta thing not done by ani arabwa to inflict pain upon men who had
not offend us in ani way suppos a parti of arm foreign were to
enter a villag church in america and break ornament from the altar
rail for curios and climb up and walk upon the bibl and the
pulpit cushion howev the case are differ one is the
profan of a templ of our faithth other onli the profan of a
pagan one

we descend to the plain again and halt a moment at a wellof
abraham time no doubt it was in a desert place it was wall three
feet abov ground with squar and heavi block of stone after the
manner of bibl pictur around it some camel stood and other knelt
there was a group of sober littl donkey with nake duski children
clamber about them or sit astrid their rump or pull their
tail tawni blackey barefoot maid array in rag and adorn
with brazen armlet and pinchbeck earr were pois waterjar upon
their head or draw water from the well a flock of sheep stood by
wait for the shepherd to fill the hollow stone with water so that
they might drinkston which like those that wall the well were
worn smooth and deepli creas by the chafe chin of a hundr
generat of thirsti anim picturesqu arab sat upon the ground
in group and solemn smoke their longstem chibouk other arab
were fill black hogskin with waterskin which well fill and
distend with water till the short leg project pain out of the
proper line look like the corps of hog bloat by drown here
was a grand orient pictur which i had worship a thousand time in
soft rich steel engrav but in the engrav there was no
desol no dirt no rag no flea no ugli featur no sore eye
no feast fli no besot ignor in the counten no raw
place on the donkey back no disagre jabber in unknown
tongu no stench of camel no suggest that a coupl of ton of
powder place under the parti and touch off would heighten the effect
and give to the scene a genuin interest and a charm which it would
alway be pleasant to recal even though a man live a thousand year
orient scene look best in steel engrav i cannot be impos upon
ani more by that pictur of the queen of sheba visit solomon i shall
say to myself you look fine madam but your feet are not clean and you
smell like a camel

present a wild arab in charg of a camel train recogn an old friend
in ferguson and they ran and fell upon each other neck and kiss
each other grimi beard face upon both cheek it explain
instant a someth which had alway seem to me onli a farfetch
orient figur of speech i refer to the circumst of christ
rebuk a pharise or some such charact and remind him that from
him he had receiv no kiss of welcom  it did not seem reason to
me that men should kiss each other but i am awar now that they did
there was reason in it too the custom was natur and proper becaus
peopl must kiss and a man would not be like to kiss one of the women
of this countri of his own free will and accord one must travel to
learn everi day now old scriptur phrase that never possess ani
signific for me befor take to themselv a mean

we journey around the base of the mountainlittl hermon past the
old crusad castl of el fuleh and arriv at shunem this was
anoth magdala to a fraction fresco and all here tradit say
the prophet samuel was born and here the shunamit woman built a littl
hous upon the citi wall for the accommod of the prophet elisha
elisha ask her what she expect in return it was a perfect natur
question for these peopl are and were in the habit of proffer favor
and servic and then expect and beg for pay elisha knew them
well he could not comprehend that ani bodi should build for him that
humbl littl chamber for the mere sake of old friendship and with no
selfish motiv whatev it use to seem a veri impolit not to say a
rude question for elisha to ask the woman but it doe not seem so to
me now the woman said she expect noth then for her good and
her unselfish he rejoic her heart with the news that she should
bear a son it was a high rewardbut she would not have thank him for
a daughterdaught have alway been unpopular here the son was born
grew wax strong die elisha restor him to life in shunem

we found here a grove of lemon treescool shadi hung with fruit one
is apt to overestim beauti when it is rare but to me this grove
seem veri beauti it was beauti i do not overestim it i
must alway rememb shunem grate as a place which gave to us this
leafi shelter after our long hot ride we lunch rest chat
smoke our pipe an hour and then mount and move on

as we trot across the plain of jezreel we met half a dozen digger
indian bedouin with veri long spear in their hand cavort around
on old crowbait hors and spear imaginari enemi whoop and
flutter their rag in the wind and carri on in everi respect like
a pack of hopeless lunat at last here were the wild free son of
the desert speed over the plain like the wind on their beauti
arabian mares we had read so much about and long so much to see here
were the picturesqu costum  this was the gallant spectacl 
tatterdemalion vagrantscheap braggadocioarabian mares spine and
neck like the ichthyosaurus in the museum and hump and corner like
a dromedari to glanc at the genuin son of the desert is to take the
romanc out of him foreverto behold his steed is to long in chariti to
strip his har off and let him fall to piec

present we came to a ruinous old town on a hill the same be the
ancient jezreel

ahab king of samaria this was a veri vast kingdom for those day and
was veri near half as larg as rhode island dwelt in the citi of
jezreel which was his capit near him live a man by the name of
naboth who had a vineyard the king ask him for it and when he would
not give it offer to buy it but naboth refus to sell it in those
day it was consid a sort of crime to part with one inherit at
ani priceand even if a man did part with it it revert to himself or
his heir again at the next jubile year so this spoil child of a
king went and lay down on the bed with his face to the wall and griev
sore the queen a notori charact in those day and whose name
is a byword and a reproach even in these came in and ask him
wherefor he sorrow and he told her jezebel said she could secur
the vineyard and she went forth and forg letter to the nobl and
wise men in the king name and order them to proclaim a fast and set
naboth on high befor the peopl and suborn two wit to swear that
he had blasphem they did it and the peopl stone the accus by the
citi wall and he die then jezebel came and told the king and said
behold naboth is no moreris up and seiz the vineyard so ahab
seiz the vineyard and went into it to possess it but the prophet
elijah came to him there and read his fate to him and the fate of
jezebel and said that in the place where dog lick the blood of
naboth dog should also lick his bloodand he said likewis the dog
should eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel in the cours of time the
king was kill in battl and when his chariot wheel were wash in the
pool of samaria the dog lick the blood in after year jehu who
was king of israel march down against jezreel by order of one of the
prophet and administ one of those convinc rebuk so common
among the peopl of those day he kill mani king and their subject
and as he came along he saw jezebel paint and fine dress look
out of a window and order that she be thrown down to him a servant
did it and jehu hors trampl her under foot then jehu went in and
sat down to dinner and present he said go and buri this curs woman
for she is a king daughter the spirit of chariti came upon him too
late howev for the propheci had alreadi been fulfilledth dog had
eaten her and they found no more of her than the skull and the feet
and the palm of her hand 

ahab the late king had left a helpless famili behind him and jehu
kill seventi of the orphan son then he kill all the relat and
teacher and servant and friend of the famili and rest from his
labor until he was come near to samaria where he met fortytwo person
and ask them who they were they said they were brother of the king of
judah he kill them when he got to samaria he said he would show
his zeal for the lord so he gather all the priest and peopl togeth
that worship baal pretend that he was go to adopt that worship
and offer up a great sacrific and when they were all shut up where they
could not defend themselv he caus everi person of them to be kill
then jehu the good missionari rest from his labor onc more

we went back to the valley and rode to the fountain of ain jelud they
call it the fountain of jezreel usual it is a pond about one hundr
feet squar and four feet deep with a stream of water trickl into it
from under an overhang ledg of rock it is in the midst of a great
solitud here gideon pitch his camp in the old time behind shunem
lay the midianit the amalekit and the children of the east  who
were as grasshopp for multitud both they and their camel were
without number as the sand by the seasid for multitud  which mean
that there were one hundr and thirtyf thousand men and that they
had transport servic accord

gideon with onli three hundr men surpris them in the night and
stood by and look on while they butcher each other until a hundr
and twenti thousand lay dead on the field

we camp at jenin befor night and got up and start again at one
oclock in the morn somewher toward daylight we pass the
local where the best authent tradit locat the pit into
which joseph brethren threw him and about noon after pass over a
success of mountain top clad with grove of fig and oliv tree
with the mediterranean in sight some forti mile away and go by mani
ancient biblic citi whose inhabit glower savag upon our
christian process and were seem inclin to practic on it with
stone we came to the singular terrac and unlov hill that
betray that we were out of galile and into samaria at last

we climb a high hill to visit the citi of samaria where the woman may
have hail from who convers with christ at jacob well and from
whenc no doubt came also the celebr good samaritan herod the
great is said to have made a magnific citi of this place and a great
number of coars limeston column twenti feet high and two feet
through that are almost guiltless of architectur grace of shape and
ornament are point out by mani author as evid of the fact they
would not have been consid handsom in ancient greec howev

the inhabit of this camp are particular vicious and stone two
parti of our pilgrim a day or two ago who brought about the difficulti
by show their revolv when they did not intend to use thema thing
which is deem bad judgment in the far west and ought certain to be
so consid ani where in the new territori when a man put his
hand on a weapon he know that he must use it he must use it instant
or expect to be shot down where he stand those pilgrim had been
read grime

there was noth for us to do in samaria but buy hand of old roman
coin at a franc a dozen and look at a dilapid church of the
crusad and a vault in it which onc contain the bodi of john the
baptist this relic was long ago carri away to genoa

samaria stood a disastr sieg onc in the day of elisha at the
hand of the king of syria provis reach such a figur that an
ass head was sold for eighti piec of silver and the fourth part of a
cab of dove dung for five piec of silver 

an incid record of that heavi time will give one a veri good idea of
the distress that prevail within these crumbl wall as the king
was walk upon the battlement one day a woman cri out say
help my lord o king and the king said what aileth thee and she
answer this woman said unto me give thi son that we may eat him
today and we will eat my son tomorrow so we boil my son and did
eat him and i said unto her on the next day give thi son that we may
eat him and she hath hid her son 

the prophet elisha declar that within four and twenti hour the price
of food should go down to noth almost and it was so the syrian
armi broke camp and fled for some caus or other the famin was
reliev from without and mani a shoddi specul in dove dung and
ass meat was ruin

we were glad to leav this hot and dusti old villag and hurri on at
two oclock we stop to lunch and rest at ancient shechem between the
histor mount of gerizim and ebal where in the old time the book of
the law the curs and the bless were read from the height to the
jewish multitud below




chapter lii

the narrow canon in which nablous or shechem is situat is under high
cultiv and the soil is exceed black and fertil it is well
water and it affluent veget gain effect by contrast with the
barren hill that tower on either side one of these hill is the
ancient mount of bless and the other the mount of curs and wise men
who seek for fulfil of propheci think they find here a wonder of
this kindto wit that the mount of bless is strang fertil and
it mate as strang unproduct we could not see that there was
realli much differ between them in this respect howev

shechem is distinguish as one of the resid of the patriarch jacob
and as the seat of those tribe that cut themselv loos from their
brethren of israel and propag doctrin not in conform with those
of the origin jewish creed for thousand of year this clan have
dwelt in shechem under strict tabu and have littl commerc or
fellowship with their fellow men of ani religion or nation for
generat they have not number more than one or two hundr but they
still adher to their ancient faith and maintain their ancient rite and
ceremoni talk of famili and old descent princ and nobl pride
themselv upon lineag they can trace back some hundr of year
what is this trifl to this hand of old first famili of shechem who
can name their father straight back without a flaw for thousand
straight back to a period so remot that men rear in a countri where
the day of two hundr year ago are call ancient time grow daze
and bewild when they tri to comprehend it here is respect
for youher is familyher is high descent worth talk about
this sad proud remnant of a onc mighti communiti still hold themselv
aloof from all the world they still live as their father live labor
as their father labor think as they did feel as they did worship in
the same place in sight of the same landmark and in the same quaint
patriarch way their ancestor did more than thirti centuri ago i
found myself gaze at ani straggl scion of this strang race with a
rivet fascin just as one would stare at a live mastodon or a
megatherium that had move in the grey dawn of creation and seen the
wonder of that mysteri world that was befor the flood

care preserv among the sacr archiv of this curious communiti
is a mss copi of the ancient jewish law which is said to be the oldest
document on earth it is written on vellum and is some four or five
thousand year old noth but bucksheesh can purchas a sight it
fame is somewhat dim in these latter day becaus of the doubt so
mani author of palestin travel have felt themselv privileg to cast
upon it speak of this mss remind me that i procur from the
highpriest of this ancient samaritan communiti at great expens a
secret document of still higher antiqu and far more extraordinari
interest which i propos to publish as soon as i have finish
translat it

joshua gave his die injunct to the children of israel at shechem
and buri a valuabl treasur secret under an oak tree there about the
same time the superstiti samaritan have alway been afraid to hunt
for it they believ it is guard by fierc spirit invis to men

about a mile and a half from shechem we halt at the base of mount ebal
befor a littl squar area inclos by a high stone wall neat
whitewash across one end of this inclosur is a tomb built after the
manner of the moslem it is the tomb of joseph no truth is better
authent than this

when joseph was die he prophesi that exodus of the israelit from
egypt which occur four hundr year afterward at the same time he
exact of his peopl an oath that when they journey to the land of
canaan they would bear his bone with them and buri them in the ancient
inherit of his father the oath was kept and the bone of joseph
which the children of israel brought up out of egypt buri they in
shechem in a parcel of ground which jacob bought of the son of hamor
the father of shechem for a hundr piec of silver 

few tomb on earth command the vener of so mani race and men of
diver creed as this of joseph samaritan and jew moslem and
christian alik rever it and honor it with their visit the tomb of
joseph the duti son the affection forgiv brother the
virtuous man the wise princ and ruler egypt felt his influenceth
world know his histori 

in this same parcel of ground which jacob bought of the son of hamor
for a hundr piec of silver is jacob celebr well it is cut in
the solid rock and is nine feet squar and nineti feet deep the name
of this unpretend hole in the ground which one might pass by and take
no notic of is as familiar as household word to even the children and
the peasant of mani a faroff countri it is more famous than the
parthenon it is older than the pyramid

it was by this well that jesus sat and talk with a woman of that
strang antiqu samaritan communiti i have been speak of and told
her of the mysteri water of life as descend of old english
nobl still cherish in the tradit of their hous how that this king
or that king tarri a day with some favor ancestor three hundr year
ago no doubt the descend of the woman of samaria live there in
shechem still refer with pardon vaniti to this convers of their
ancestor held some littl time gone by with the messiah of the
christian it is not like that they undervalu a distinct such as
this samaritan natur is human natur and human natur rememb
contact with the illustri alway

for an offens done to the famili honor the son of jacob extermin
all shechem onc

we left jacob well and travel till eight in the even but rather
slowli for we had been in the saddl nineteen hour and the hors were
cruelli tire we got so far ahead of the tent that we had to camp in
an arab villag and sleep on the ground we could have slept in the
largest of the hous but there were some littl drawback it was
popul with vermin it had a dirt floor it was in no respect clean
and there was a famili of goat in the onli bedroom and two donkey in
the parlor outsid there were no inconveni except that the duski
rag earnestey villag of both sex and all age group
themselv on their haunch all around us and discuss us and
criticis us with noisi tongu till midnight we did not mind the
nois be tire but doubtless the reader is awar that it is almost
an imposs thing to go to sleep when you know that peopl are look
at you we went to bed at ten and got up again at two and start onc
more thus are peopl persecut by dragomen whose sole ambit in
life is to get ahead of each other

about daylight we pass shiloh where the ark of the coven rest
three hundr year and at whose gate good old eli fell down and brake
his neck when the messeng ride hard from the battl told him of
the defeat of his peopl the death of his son and more than all the
captur of israel pride her hope her refug the ancient ark her
forefath brought with them out of egypt it is littl wonder that
under circumst like these he fell down and brake his neck but
shiloh had no charm for us we were so cold that there was no comfort
but in motion and so drowsi we could hard sit upon the hors

after a while we came to a shapeless mass of ruin which still bear the
name of bethel it was here that jacob lay down and had that superb
vision of angel flit up and down a ladder that reach from the
cloud to earth and caught glimps of their bless home through the
open gate of heaven

the pilgrim took what was left of the hallow ruin and we press on
toward the goal of our crusad renown jerusalem

the further we went the hotter the sun got and the more rocki and bare
repuls and dreari the landscap becam there could not have been
more fragment of stone strewn broadcast over this part of the world if
everi ten squar feet of the land had been occupi by a separ and
distinct stonecutt establish for an age there was hard a tree
or a shrub ani where even the oliv and the cactus those fast friend
of a worthless soil had almost desert the countri no landscap
exist that is more tiresom to the eye than that which bound the
approach to jerusalem the onli differ between the road and the
surround countri perhap is that there are rather more rock in the
road than in the surround countri

we pass ramah and beroth and on the right saw the tomb of the prophet
samuel perch high upon a command emin still no jerusalem came
in sight we hurri on impati we halt a moment at the ancient
fountain of beira but it stone worn deepli by the chin of thirsti
anim that are dead and gone centuri ago had no interest for usw
long to see jerusalem we spur up hill after hill and usual
began to stretch our neck minut befor we got to the topbut
disappoint alway follow more stupid hill beyondmor unsight
landscapeno holi citi

at last away in the middl of the day ancient bite of wall and
crumbl arch began to line the wayw toil up one more hill and
everi pilgrim and everi sinner swung his hat on high jerusalem

perch on it etern hill white and dome and solid mass togeth
and hoop with high gray wall the vener citi gleam in the sun
so small whi it was no larger than an american villag of four
thousand inhabit and no larger than an ordinari syrian citi of
thirti thousand jerusalem number onli fourteen thousand peopl

we dismount and look without speak a dozen sentenc across the
wide interven valley for an hour or more and note those promin
featur of the citi that pictur make familiar to all men from their
school day till their death we could recogn the tower of hippicus
the mosqu of omar the damascus gate the mount of oliv the valley of
jehoshaphat the tower of david and the garden of gethsemaneand date
from these landmark could tell veri near the local of mani other
we were not abl to distinguish

i record it here as a notabl but not discredit fact that not even
our pilgrim wept i think there was no individu in the parti whose
brain was not teem with thought and imag and memori invok by
the grand histori of the vener citi that lay befor us but still
among them all was no voic of them that wept 

there was no call for tear tear would have been out of place the
thought jerusalem suggest are full of poetri sublim and more than
all digniti such thought do not find their appropri express in
the emot of the nurseri

just after noon we enter these narrow crook street by the ancient
and the fame damascus gate and now for sever hour i have been tri
to comprehend that i am actual in the illustri old citi where
solomon dwelt where abraham held convers with the deiti and where
wall still stand that wit the spectacl of the crucifixion




chapter liii

a fast walker could go outsid the wall of jerusalem and walk entir
around the citi in an hour i do not know how els to make one
understand how small it is the appear of the citi is peculiar it
is as knobbi with countless littl dome as a prison door is with
bolthead everi hous has from one to half a dozen of these white
plaster dome of stone broad and low sit in the centr of or in
a cluster upon the flat roof wherefor when one look down from an
emin upon the compact mass of hous so close crowd togeth
in fact that there is no appear of street at all and so the citi
look solid he see the knobbiest town in the world except
constantinopl it look as if it might be roof from centr to
circumfer with invert saucer the monotoni of the view is
interrupt onli by the great mosqu of omar the tower of hippicus and
one or two other build that rise into command promin

the hous are general two stori high built strong of masonri
whitewash or plaster outsid and have a cage of wooden latticework
project in front of everi window to reproduc a jerusalem street it
would onli be necessari to upend a chickencoop and hang it befor each
window in an alley of american hous

the street are rough and bad pave with stone and are toler
crookedenough so to make each street appear to close togeth
constant and come to an end about a hundr yard ahead of a pilgrim as
long as he choos to walk in it project from the top of the lower
stori of mani of the hous is a veri narrow porchroof or shed without
support from below and i have sever time seen cat jump across the
street from one shed to the other when they were out call the cat
could have jump doubl the distanc without extraordinari exert i
mention these thing to give an idea of how narrow the street are
sinc a cat can jump across them without the least inconveni it is
hard necessari to state that such street are too narrow for carriag
these vehicl cannot navig the holi citi

the popul of jerusalem is compos of moslem jew greek latin
armenian syrian copt abyssinian greek cathol and a hand of
protest one hundr of the latter sect are all that dwell now in
this birthplac of christian the nice shade of nation
compris in the abov list and the languag spoken by them are
altogeth too numer to mention it seem to me that all the race
and color and tongu of the earth must be repres among the
fourteen thousand soul that dwell in jerusalem rag wretched
poverti and dirt those sign and symbol that indic the presenc of
moslem rule more sure than the crescentflag itself abound leper
crippl the blind and the idiot assail you on everi hand and they
know but one word of but one languag apparentlyth etern
bucksheesh  to see the number of maim malform and diseas
human that throng the holi place and obstruct the gate one might
suppos that the ancient day had come again and that the angel of the
lord was expect to descend at ani moment to stir the water of
bethesda jerusalem is mourn and dreari and lifeless i would not
desir to live here

one natur goe first to the holi sepulchr it is right in the citi
near the western gate it and the place of the crucifixion and in fact
everi other place intim connect with that tremend event are
ingeni mass togeth and cover by one roofth dome of the
church of the holi sepulchr

enter the build through the midst of the usual assemblag of
beggar one see on his left a few turkish guardsfor christian of
differ sect will not onli quarrel but fight also in this sacr
place if allow to do it befor you is a marbl slab which cover
the stone of unction whereon the saviour bodi was laid to prepar it
for burial it was found necessari to conceal the real stone in this way
in order to save it from destruct pilgrim were too much given to
chip off piec of it to carri home near by is a circular rail
which mark the spot where the virgin stood when the lord bodi was
anoint

enter the great rotunda we stand befor the most sacr local in
christendomth grave of jesus it is in the centr of the church and
immedi under the great dome it is inclos in a sort of littl
templ of yellow and white stone of fanci design within the littl
templ is a portion of the veri stone which was roll away from the door
of the sepulchr and on which the angel was sit when mari came
thither at earli dawn  stoop low we enter the vaultth sepulchr
itself it is onli about six feet by seven and the stone couch on which
the dead saviour lay extend from end to end of the apart and
occupi half it width it is cover with a marbl slab which has been
much worn by the lip of pilgrim this slab serv as an altar now
over it hang some fifti gold and silver lamp which are kept alway
burn and the place is otherwis scandal by trumperi gewgaw and
tawdri ornament

all sect of christian except protest have chapel under the roof
of the church of the holi sepulchr and each must keep to itself and not
ventur upon anoth ground it has been proven conclus that they
can not worship togeth around the grave of the saviour of the world in
peac the chapel of the syrian is not handsom that of the copt is
the humblest of them all it is noth but a dismal cavern rough
hewn in the live rock of the hill of calvari in one side of it two
ancient tomb are hewn which are claim to be those in which nicodemus
and joseph of aramathea were buri

as we move among the great pier and pillar of anoth part of the
church we came upon a parti of blackrob animallook italian
monk with candl in their hand who were chant someth in latin
and go through some kind of religi perform around a disk of
white marbl let into the floor it was there that the risen saviour
appear to mari magdalen in the like of a garden near by was a
similar stone shape like a starher the magdalen herself stood at
the same time monk were perform in this place also they perform
everywhereal over the vast build and at all hour their candl
are alway flit about in the gloom and make the dim old church
more dismal than there is ani necess that it should be even though it
is a tomb

we were shown the place where our lord appear to his mother after the
resurrect here also a marbl slab mark the place where st
helena the mother of the emperor constantin found the cross about
three hundr year after the crucifixion accord to the legend this
great discoveri elicit extravag demonstr of joy but they
were of short durat the question intrud itself which bore the
bless saviour and which the thiev  to be in doubt in so mighti a
matter as thisto be uncertain which one to adorewa a grievous
misfortun it turn the public joy to sorrow but when live there a
holi priest who could not set so simpl a troubl as this at rest one
of these soon hit upon a plan that would be a certain test a nobl ladi
lay veri ill in jerusalem the wise priest order that the three
cross be taken to her bedsid one at a time it was done when her
eye fell upon the first one she utter a scream that was heard beyond
the damascus gate and even upon the mount of oliv it was said and
then fell back in a dead swoon they recov her and brought the
second cross instant she went into fear convuls and it was
with the greatest difficulti that six strong men could hold her they
were afraid now to bring in the third cross they began to fear that
possibl they had fallen upon the wrong cross and that the true cross
was not with this number at all howev as the woman seem like to
die with the convuls that were tear her they conclud that the
third could do no more than put her out of her miseri with a happi
dispatch so they brought it and behold a miracl the woman sprang
from her bed smile and joy and perfect restor to health when
we listen to evid like this we cannot but believ we would be
asham to doubt and proper too even the veri part of jerusalem
where this all occur is there yet so there is realli no room for
doubt

the priest tri to show us through a small screen a fragment of the
genuin pillar of flagel to which christ was bound when they
scourg him but we could not see it becaus it was dark insid the
screen howev a baton is kept here which the pilgrim thrust through
a hole in the screen and then he no longer doubt that the true pillar
of flagel is in there he can not have ani excus to doubt it for
he can feel it with the stick he can feel it as distinct as he could
feel ani thing

not far from here was a nich where they use to preserv a piec of the
true cross but it is gone now this piec of the cross was discov
in the sixteenth centuri the latin priest say it was stolen away long
ago by priest of anoth sect that seem like a hard statement to
make but we know veri well that it was stolen becaus we have seen it
ourselv in sever of the cathedr of itali and franc

but the relic that touch us most was the plain old sword of that stout
crusad godfrey of bulloignek godfrey of jerusalem no blade in
christendom wield such enchant as thisno blade of all that rust in
the ancestr hall of europ is abl to invok such vision of romanc
in the brain of him who look upon itnon that can prate of such
chivalr deed or tell such brave tale of the warrior day of old it
stir within a man everi memori of the holi war that has been sleep
in his brain for year and peopl his thought with mailclad imag
with march armi with battl and with sieg it speak to him of
baldwin and tancr the princ saladin and great richard of the lion
heart it was with just such blade as these that these splendid hero
of romanc use to segreg a man so to speak and leav the half of
him to fall one way and the other half the other this veri sword has
cloven hundr of saracen knight from crown to chin in those old time
when godfrey wield it it was enchant then by a genius that was
under the command of king solomon when danger approach it master
tent it alway struck the shield and clang out a fierc alarm upon the
startl ear of night in time of doubt or in fog or dark if it
were drawn from it sheath it would point instant toward the foe and
thus reveal the wayand it would also attempt to start after them of it
own accord a christian could not be so disguis that it would not know
him and refus to hurt himnor a moslem so disguis that it would not
leap from it scabbard and take his life these statement are all well
authent in mani legend that are among the most trustworthi legend
the good old cathol monk preserv i can never forget old godfrey
sword now i tri it on a moslem and clove him in twain like a
doughnut the spirit of grime was upon me and if i had had a graveyard
i would have destroy all the infidel in jerusalem i wipe the blood
off the old sword and hand it back to the priesti did not want the
fresh gore to obliter those sacr spot that crimson it bright
one day six hundr year ago and thus gave godfrey warn that befor
the sun went down his journey of life would end

still move through the gloom of the church of the holi sepulchr we
came to a small chapel hewn out of the rocka place which has been
known as the prison of our lord for mani centuri tradit say
that here the saviour was confin just previous to the crucifixion
under an altar by the door was a pair of stone stock for human leg
these thing are call the bond of christ  and the use they were onc
put to has given them the name they now bear

the greek chapel is the most roomi the richest and the showiest chapel
in the church of the holi sepulchr it altar like that of all the
greek church is a lofti screen that extend clear across the chapel
and is gorgeous with gild and pictur the numer lamp that hang
befor it are of gold and silver and cost great sum

but the featur of the place is a short column that rise from the middl
of the marbl pavement of the chapel and mark the exact centr of the
earth the most reliabl tradit tell us that this was known to be
the earth centr age ago and that when christ was upon earth he set
all doubt upon the subject at rest forev by state with his own lip
that the tradit was correct rememb he said that that particular
column stood upon the centr of the world if the centr of the world
chang the column chang it posit accord this column has
move three differ time of it own accord this is becaus in great
convuls of natur at three differ time mass of the earth
whole rang of mountain probablyhav flown off into space thus
lessen the diamet of the earth and chang the exact local of
it centr by a point or two this is a veri curious and interest
circumst and is a wither rebuk to those philosoph who would
make us believ that it is not possibl for ani portion of the earth to
fli off into space

to satisfi himself that this spot was realli the centr of the earth a
sceptic onc paid well for the privileg of ascend to the dome of the
church to see if the sun gave him a shadow at noon he came down
perfect convinc the day was veri cloudi and the sun threw no
shadow at all but the man was satisfi that if the sun had come out
and made shadow it could not have made ani for him proof like these
are not to be set asid by the idl tongu of cavil to such as are
not bigot and are will to be convinc they carri a convict
that noth can ever shake

if even greater proof than those i have mention are want to satisfi
the headstrong and the foolish that this is the genuin centr of the
earth they are here the greatest of them lie in the fact that from
under this veri column was taken the dust from which adam was made this
can sure be regard in the light of a settler it is not like that
the origin first man would have been made from an inferior qualiti of
earth when it was entir conveni to get first qualiti from the
world centr this will strike ani reflect mind forcibl that
adam was form of dirt procur in this veri spot is ampli proven by the
fact that in six thousand year no man has ever been abl to prove that
the dirt was not procur here whereof he was made

it is a singular circumst that right under the roof of this same
great church and not far away from that illustri column adam
himself the father of the human race lie buri there is no question
that he is actual buri in the grave which is point out as his
there can be nonebecaus it has never yet been proven that that grave
is not the grave in which he is buri

the tomb of adam how touch it was here in a land of stranger far
away from home and friend and all who care for me thus to discov
the grave of a blood relat true a distant one but still a
relat the uner instinct of natur thrill it recognit the
fountain of my filial affect was stir to it profoundest depth
and i gave way to tumultu emot i lean upon a pillar and burst
into tear i deem it no shame to have wept over the grave of my poor
dead relat let him who would sneer at my emot close this volum
here for he will find littl to his tast in my journey through holi
land nobl old manh did not live to see meh did not live to see
his child and iiala i did not live to see him weigh down by
sorrow and disappoint he die befor i was bornsix thousand brief
summer befor i was born but let us tri to bear it with fortitud
let us trust that he is better off where he is let us take comfort in
the thought that his loss is our etern gain

the next place the guid took us to in the holi church was an altar
dedic to the roman soldier who was of the militari guard that
attend at the crucifixion to keep order and whowhen the vail of the
templ was rent in the aw dark that follow when the rock of
golgotha was split asund by an earthquak when the artilleri of heaven
thunder and in the bale glare of the lightn the shroud dead
flit about the street of jerusalemshook with fear and said sure
this was the son of god  where this altar stand now that roman
soldier stood then in full view of the crucifi saviourin full sight
and hear of all the marvel that were transpir far and wide about
the circumfer of the hill of calvari and in this selfsam spot the
priest of the templ behead him for those blasphem word he had
spoken

in this altar they use to keep one of the most curious relic that human
eye ever look upona thing that had power to fascin the behold
in some mysteri way and keep him gaze for hour togeth it was
noth less than the copper plate pilat put upon the saviour cross
and upon which he wrote this is the king of the jew  i think st
helena the mother of constantin found this wonder memento when she
was here in the third centuri she travel all over palestin and was
alway fortun whenev the good old enthusiast found a thing
mention in her bibl old or new she would go and search for that
thing and never stop until she found it if it was adam she would find
adam if it was the ark she would find the ark if it was goliath or
joshua she would find them she found the inscript here that i was
speak of i think she found it in this veri spot close to where the
martyr roman soldier stood that copper plate is in one of the
church in rome now ani one can see it there the inscript is
veri distinct

we pass along a few step and saw the altar built over the veri spot
where the good cathol priest say the soldier divid the raiment of
the saviour

then we went down into a cavern which cavil say was onc a cistern
it is a chapel now howeverth chapel of st helena it is fiftyon
feet long by fortythre wide in it is a marbl chair which helena use
to sit in while she superintend her workmen when they were dig and
delv for the true cross in this place is an altar dedic to st
dima the penit thief a new bronz statu is herea statu of st
helena it remind us of poor maximilian so late shot he present
it to this chapel when he was about to leav for his throne in mexico

from the cistern we descend twelv step into a larg roughlyshap
grotto carv wholli out of the live rock helena blast it out when
she was search for the true cross she had a labori piec of work
here but it was rich reward out of this place she got the crown of
thorn the nail of the cross the true cross itself and the cross of
the penit thief when she thought she had found everi thing and was
about to stop she was told in a dream to continu a day longer it was
veri fortun she did so and found the cross of the other thief

the wall and roof of this grotto still weep bitter tear in memori of
the event that transpir on calvari and devout pilgrim groan and sob
when these sad tear fall upon them from the drip rock the monk
call this apart the chapel of the invent of the crossa name
which is unfortun becaus it lead the ignor to imagin that a
tacit acknowledg is thus made that the tradit that helena found
the true cross here is a fictionan invent it is a happi to
know howev that intellig peopl do not doubt the stori in ani of
it particular

priest of ani of the chapel and denomin in the church of the holi
sepulchr can visit this sacr grotto to weep and pray and worship the
gentl redeem two differ congreg are not allow to enter at
the same time howev becaus they alway fight

still march through the vener church of the holi sepulchr among
chant priest in coars long robe and sandal pilgrim of all color
and mani nation in all sort of strang costum under duski
arch and by dingi pier and column through a sombr cathedr gloom
freight with smoke and incens and faint star with score of
candl that appear sudden and as sudden disappear or drift
mysteri hither and thither about the distant aisl like ghost
jackolanternsw came at last to a small chapel which is call the
chapel of the mock  under the altar was a fragment of a marbl
column this was the seat christ sat on when he was revil and
mock made king crown with a crown of thorn and sceptr with a
reed it was here that they blindfold him and struck him and said in
deris prophesi who it is that smote thee  the tradit that this
is the ident spot of the mock is a veri ancient one the guid
said that saewulf was the first to mention it i do not know saewulf
but still i cannot well refus to receiv his evidencenon of us can

they show us where the great godfrey and his brother baldwin the first
christian king of jerusalem onc lay buri by that sacr sepulchr
they had fought so long and so valiant to wrest from the hand of the
infidel but the nich that had contain the ash of these renown
crusad were empti even the cover of their tomb were gone
destroy by devout member of the greek church becaus godfrey and
baldwin were latin princ and had been rear in a christian faith
whose creed differ in some unimport respect from their

we pass on and halt befor the tomb of melchisedek you will
rememb melchisedek no doubt he was the king who came out and levi a
tribut on abraham the time that he pursu lot captor to dan and
took all their properti from them that was about four thousand year
ago and melchisedek die short afterward howev his tomb is in a
good state of preserv

when one enter the church of the holi sepulchr the sepulchr itself is
the first thing he desir to see and realli is almost the first thing
he doe see the next thing he has a strong yearn to see is the spot
where the saviour was crucifi but this they exhibit last it is the
crown glori of the place one is grave and thought when he stand
in the littl tomb of the saviourh could not well be otherwis in such
a placebut he has not the slightest possibl belief that ever the lord
lay there and so the interest he feel in the spot is veri veri great
mar by that reflect he look at the place where mari stood in
anoth part of the church and where john stood and mari magdalen
where the mob derid the lord where the angel sat where the crown of
thorn was found and the true cross where the risen saviour appear
he look at all these place with interest but with the same convict
he felt in the case of the sepulchr that there is noth genuin about
them and that they are imaginari holi place creat by the monk but
the place of the crucifixion affect him differ he fulli believ
that he is look upon the veri spot where the savior gave up his
life he rememb that christ was veri celebr long befor he came
to jerusalem he know that his fame was so great that crowd follow
him all the time he is awar that his entri into the citi produc a
stir sensat and that his recept was a kind of ovat he can
not overlook the fact that when he was crucifi there were veri mani in
jerusalem who believ that he was the true son of god to public
execut such a personag was suffici in itself to make the local of
the execut a memor place for age ad to this the storm the
dark the earthquak the rend of the vail of the templ and the
untim wake of the dead were event calcul to fix the execut
and the scene of it in the memori of even the most thoughtless wit
father would tell their son about the strang affair and point out the
spot the son would transmit the stori to their children and thus a
period of three hundr year would easili be spannedth thought is
mr prime not mine and is full of good sens i borrow it from his
tent life m t at which time helena came and built a church upon
calvari to commemor the death and burial of the lord and preserv the
sacr place in the memori of men sinc that time there has alway
been a church there it is not possibl that there can be ani mistak
about the local of the crucifixion not half a dozen person knew
where they buri the saviour perhap and a burial is not a startl
event ani how therefor we can be pardon for unbelief in the
sepulchr but not in the place of the crucifixion five hundr year
henc there will be no vestig of bunker hill monument left but america
will still know where the battl was fought and where warren fell the
crucifixion of christ was too notabl an event in jerusalem and the hill
of calvari made too celebr by it to be forgotten in the short space
of three hundr year i climb the stairway in the church which
bring one to the top of the small inclos pinnacl of rock and look
upon the place where the true cross onc stood with a far more absorb
interest than i had ever felt in ani thing earth befor i could not
believ that the three hole in the top of the rock were the actual one
the cross stood in but i felt satisfi that those cross had stood
so near the place now occupi by them that the few feet of possibl
differ were a matter of no consequ

when one stand where the saviour was crucifi he find it all he can
do to keep it strict befor his mind that christ was not crucifi in a
cathol church he must remind himself everi now and then that the
great event transpir in the open air and not in a gloomi
candlelight cell in a littl corner of a vast church upstair
a small cell all bejewel and bespangl with flashi ornament
in execr tast

under a marbl altar like a tabl is a circular hole in the marbl
floor correspond with the one just under it in which the true cross
stood the first thing everi one doe is to kneel down and take a candl
and examin this hole he doe this strang prospect with an amount
of graviti that can never be estim or appreci by a man who has
not seen the oper then he hold his candl befor a rich
engrav pictur of the saviour done on a messi slab of gold and
wonder ray and star with diamond which hang abov the hole
within the altar and his solemn chang to live admir he
rise and face the fine wrought figur of the saviour and the
malefactor uplift upon their cross behind the altar and bright with
a metal lustr of mani color he turn next to the figur close to
them of the virgin and mari magdalen next to the rift in the live rock
made by the earthquak at the time of the crucifixion and an extens
of which he had seen befor in the wall of one of the grotto below he
look next at the showcas with a figur of the virgin in it and is
amaz at the princ fortun in precious gem and jewelri that hang so
thick about the form as to hide it like a garment almost all about
the apart the gaudi trap of the greek church offend the eye and
keep the mind on the rack to rememb that this is the place of the
crucifixiongolgothath mount of calvari and the last thing he look
at is that which was also the firstth place where the true cross
stood that will chain him to the spot and compel him to look onc more
and onc again after he has satisfi all curios and lost all
interest concern the other matter pertain to the local

and so i close my chapter on the church of the holi sepulchreth most
sacr local on earth to million and million of men and women and
children the nobl and the humbl bond and free in it histori from
the first and in it tremend associ it is the most illustri
edific in christendom with all it claptrap sideshow and unseem
impostur of everi kind it is still grand reverend venerablefor a
god die there for fifteen hundr year it shrine have been wet with
the tear of pilgrim from the earth remotest confin for more than
two hundr the most gallant knight that ever wield sword wast
their live away in a struggl to seiz it and hold it sacr from
infidel pollut even in our own day a war that cost million of
treasur and river of blood was fought becaus two rival nation
claim the sole right to put a new dome upon it histori is full of
this old church of the holi sepulchreful of blood that was shed
becaus of the respect and the vener in which men held the last
restingplac of the meek and lowli the mild and gentl princ of
peac




chapter liv

we were stand in a narrow street by the tower of antonio on these
stone that are crumbl away  the guid said the saviour sat and
rest befor take up the cross this is the begin of the
sorrow way or the way of grief  the parti took note of the sacr
spot and move on we pass under the ecc homo arch  and saw the
veri window from which pilat wife warn her husband to have noth
to do with the persecut of the just man this window is in an
excel state of preserv consid it great age they show
us where jesus rest the second time and where the mob refus to give
him up and said let his blood be upon our head and upon our
children children forev  the french cathol are build a church
on this spot and with their usual vener for histor relic are
incorpor into the new such scrap of ancient wall as they have
found there further on we saw the spot where the faint saviour fell
under the weight of his cross a great granit column of some ancient
templ lay there at the time and the heavi cross struck it such a blow
that it broke in two in the middl such was the guid stori when he
halt us befor the broken column

we cross a street and came present to the former resid of st
veronica when the saviour pass there she came out full of woman
compass and spoke piti word to him undaunt by the hoot and
the threaten of the mob and wipe the perspir from his face
with her handkerchief we had heard so much of st veronica and seen
her pictur by so mani master that it was like meet an old friend
unexpect to come upon her ancient home in jerusalem the strangest
thing about the incid that has made her name so famous is that when
she wipe the perspir away the print of the saviour face remain
upon the handkerchief a perfect portrait and so remain unto this day
we knew this becaus we saw this handkerchief in a cathedr in pari
in anoth in spain and in two other in itali in the milan cathedr
it cost five franc to see it and at st peter at rome it is almost
imposs to see it at ani price no tradit is so ampli verifi as
this of st veronica and her handkerchief

at the next corner we saw a deep indent in the hard stone masonri of
the corner of a hous but might have gone heedless by it but that the
guid said it was made by the elbow of the saviour who stumbl here and
fell present we came to just such anoth indent in a stone wall
the guid said the saviour fell here also and made this depress with
his elbow

there were other place where the lord fell and other where he rest
but one of the most curious landmark of ancient histori we found on this
morn walk through the crook lane that lead toward calvari was a
certain stone built into a housea stone that was so seam and scar
that it bore a sort of grotesqu resembl to the human face the
project that answer for cheek were worn smooth by the passion
kiss of generat of pilgrim from distant land we ask whi 
the guid said it was becaus this was one of the veri stone of
jerusalem that christ mention when he was reprov for permit the
peopl to cri hosannah  when he made his memor entri into the
citi upon an ass one of the pilgrim said but there is no evid
that the stone did cri outchrist said that if the peopl stop from
shout hosannah the veri stone would do it  the guid was perfect
seren he said calm this is one of the stone that would have
cri out it was of littl use to tri to shake this fellow simpl
faithit was easi to see that

and so we came at last to anoth wonder of deep and abid interest
the verit hous where the unhappi wretch onc live who has been
celebr in song and stori for more than eighteen hundr year as the
wander jew on the memor day of the crucifixion he stood in this
old doorway with his arm akimbo look out upon the struggl mob
that was approach and when the weari saviour would have sat down and
rest him a moment push him rude away and said move on  the
lord said move on thou likewis  and the command has never been
revok from that day to this all men know how that the miscreant upon
whose head that just curs fell has roam up and down the wide world
for age and age seek rest and never find itcourt death but
alway in vainlong to stop in citi in wilder in desert
solitud yet hear alway that relentless warn to marchmarch on
they saydo these hoari traditionsthat when titus sack jerusalem and
slaughter eleven hundr thousand jew in her street and byway the
wander jew was seen alway in the thickest of the fight and that when
battleax gleam in the air he bow his head beneath them when
sword flash their dead lightn he sprang in their way he bare
his breast to whizz javelin to hiss arrow to ani and to everi
weapon that promis death and forget and rest but it was
uselessh walk forth out of the carnag without a wound and it is
said that five hundr year afterward he follow mahomet when he
carri destruct to the citi of arabia and then turn against him
hope in this way to win the death of a traitor his calcul were
wrong again no quarter was given to ani live creatur but one and
that was the onli one of all the host that did not want it he sought
death five hundr year later in the war of the crusad and offer
himself to famin and pestil at ascalon he escap againh could
not die these repeat annoy could have at last but one effect
they shook his confid sinc then the wander jew has carri on a
kind of desultori toy with the most promis of the aid and
implement of destruct but with small hope as a general thing he
has specul some in cholera and railroad and has taken almost a
live interest in infern machin and patent medicin he is old
now and grave as becom an age like his he indulg in no light
amus save that he goe sometim to execut and is fond of
funer

there is one thing he can not avoid go where he will about the world he
must never fail to report in jerusalem everi fiftieth year onli a year
or two ago he was here for the thirtyseventh time sinc jesus was
crucifi on calvari they say that mani old peopl who are here now
saw him then and had seen him befor he look alway the sameold
and wither and hollowey and listless save that there is about him
someth which seem to suggest that he is look for some one
expect some oneth friend of his youth perhap but the most of
them are dead now he alway poke about the old street look
lonesom make his mark on a wall here and there and eye the oldest
build with a sort of friend half interest and he shed a few tear
at the threshold of his ancient dwell and bitter bitter tear they
are then he collect his rent and leav again he has been seen
stand near the church of the holi sepulchr on mani a starlight night
for he has cherish an idea for mani centuri that if he could onli
enter there he could rest but when he approach the door slam to
with a crash the earth trembl and all the light in jerusalem burn a
ghast blue he doe this everi fifti year just the same it is
hopeless but then it is hard to break habit one has been eighteen
hundr year accustom to the old tourist is far away on his
wander now how he must smile to see a pack of blockhead like us
gallop about the world and look wise and imagin we are find
out a good deal about it he must have a consum contempt for the
ignor complac ass that go skurri about the world in these
railroad day and call it travel

when the guid point out where the wander jew had left his familiar
mark upon a wall i was fill with astonish it read

s t x 

all i have reveal about the wander jew can be ampli proven by
refer to our guid

the mighti mosqu of omar and the pave court around it occupi a fourth
part of jerusalem they are upon mount moriah where king solomon
templ stood this mosqu is the holiest place the mohammedan know
outsid of mecca up to within a year or two past no christian could
gain admiss to it or it court for love or money but the prohibit
has been remov and we enter freeli for bucksheesh

i need not speak of the wonder beauti and the exquisit grace and
symmetri that have made this mosqu so celebratedbecaus i did not see
them one can not see such thing at an instant glanceon frequent
onli find out how realli beauti a realli beauti woman is after
consider acquaint with her and the rule appli to niagara
fall to majest mountain and to mosquesespeci to mosqu

the great featur of the mosqu of omar is the prodigi rock in the
centr of it rotunda it was upon this rock that abraham came so near
offer up his son isaacthi at least is authenticit is veri much
more to be reli on than most of the tradit at ani rate on this
rock also the angel stood and threaten jerusalem and david persuad
him to spare the citi mahomet was well acquaint with this stone
from it he ascend to heaven the stone tri to follow him and if the
angel gabriel had not happen by the merest good luck to be there to
seiz it it would have done it veri few peopl have a grip like
gabrielth print of his monstrous finger two inch deep are to be
seen in that rock today

this rock larg as it is is suspend in the air it doe not touch
ani thing at all the guid said so this is veri wonder in the
place on it where mahomet stood he left his footprint in the solid
stone i should judg that he wore about eighteen but what i was
go to say when i spoke of the rock be suspend was that in the
floor of the cavern under it they show us a slab which they said
cover a hole which was a thing of extraordinari interest to all
mohammedan becaus that hole lead down to perdit and everi soul
that is transfer from thenc to heaven must pass up through this
orific mahomet stand there and lift them out by the hair all
mohammedan shave their head but they are care to leav a lock of
hair for the prophet to take hold of our guid observ that a good
mohammedan would consid himself doom to stay with the damn forev
if he were to lose his scalplock and die befor it grew again the most
of them that i have seen ought to stay with the damn ani how without
refer to how they were barber

for sever age no woman has been allow to enter the cavern where that
import hole is the reason is that one of the sex was onc caught
there blab everi thing she knew about what was go on abov ground
to the rapscallion in the infern region down below she carri her
gossip to such an extrem that noth could be kept privatenoth
could be done or said on earth but everi bodi in perdit knew all about
it befor the sun went down it was about time to suppress this woman
telegraph and it was prompt done her breath subsid about the same
time

the insid of the great mosqu is veri showi with varieg marbl wall
and with window and inscript of elabor mosaic the turk have
their sacr relic like the cathol the guid show us the
verit armor worn by the great soninlaw and successor of mahomet
and also the buckler of mahomet uncl the great iron rail which
surround the rock was ornament in one place with a thousand rag tie
to it open work these are to remind mahomet not to forget the
worship who place them there it is consid the next best thing
to tie thread around his finger by way of remind

just outsid the mosqu is a miniatur templ which mark the spot where
david and goliah use to sit and judg the peopl a pilgrim inform
me that it was not david and goliah but david and saul i stick to my
own statementth guid told me and he ought to know 

everi where about the mosqu of omar are portion of pillar curious
wrought altar and fragment of eleg carv marblepreci
remain of solomon templ these have been dug from all depth in the
soil and rubbish of mount moriah and the moslem have alway shown a
disposit to preserv them with the utmost care at that portion of
the ancient wall of solomon templ which is call the jew place of
wail and where the hebrew assembl everi friday to kiss the
vener stone and weep over the fallen great of zion ani one can
see a part of the unquest and undisput templ of solomon the same
consist of three or four stone lie one upon the other each of
which is about twice as long as a sevenoctav piano and about as thick
as such a piano is high but as i have remark befor it is onli a
year or two ago that the ancient edict prohibit christian rubbish like
ourselv to enter the mosqu of omar and see the cost marbl that
onc adorn the inner templ was annul the design wrought upon
these fragment are all quaint and peculiar and so the charm of novelti
is ad to the deep interest they natur inspir one meet with
these vener scrap at everi turn especi in the neighbor
mosqu el aksa into whose inner wall a veri larg number of them are
care built for preserv these piec of stone stain and
dusti with age dim hint at a grandeur we have all been taught to
regard as the princeliest ever seen on earth and they call up pictur
of a pageant that is familiar to all imaginationscamel laden with
spice and treasurebeauti slave present for solomon harema
long cavalcad of rich caparison beast and warriorsand sheba
queen in the van of this vision of orient magnific  these
eleg fragment bear a richer interest than the solemn vast of the
stone the jew kiss in the place of wail can ever have for the
heedless sinner

down in the hollow ground underneath the oliv and the orangetre
that flourish in the court of the great mosqu is a wilder of
pillarsremain of the ancient templ they support it there are
ponder archway down there also over which the destroy plough
of propheci pass harmless it is pleasant to know we are disappoint
in that we never dream we might see portion of the actual templ of
solomon and yet experi no shadow of suspicion that they were a
monkish humbug and a fraud

we are surfeit with sight noth has ani fascin for us now
but the church of the holi sepulchr we have been there everi day and
have not grown tire of it but we are weari of everi thing els the
sight are too mani they swarm about you at everi step no singl foot
of ground in all jerusalem or within it neighborhood seem to be without
a stir and import histori of it own it is a veri relief to
steal a walk of a hundr yard without a guid along to talk unceas
about everi stone you step upon and drag you back age and age to the
day when it achiev celebr

it seem hard real when i find myself lean for a moment on a ruin
wall and look listless down into the histor pool of bethesda i
did not think such thing could be so crowd togeth as to diminish
their interest but in serious truth we have been drift about for
sever day use our eye and our ear more from a sens of duti than
ani higher and worthier reason and too often we have been glad when it
was time to go home and be distress no more about illustri
local

our pilgrim compress too much into one day one can gorg sight to
replet as well as sweetmeat sinc we breakfast this morn we
have seen enough to have furnish us food for a year reflect if we
could have seen the various object in comfort and look upon them
deliber we visit the pool of hezekiah where david saw uriah
wife come from the bath and fell in love with her

we went out of the citi by the jaffa gate and of cours were told mani
thing about it tower of hippicus

we rode across the valley of hinnom between two of the pool of gihon
and by an aqueduct built by solomon which still convey water to the
citi we ascend the hill of evil counsel where juda receiv his
thirti piec of silver and we also linger a moment under the tree a
vener tradit say he hang himself on

we descend to the canon again and then the guid began to give name
and histori to everi bank and boulder we came to this was the field of
blood these cut in the rock were shrine and templ of moloch
here they sacrif children yonder is the zion gate the tyropean
valley the hill of ophel here is the junction of the valley of
jehoshaphaton your right is the well of job  we turn up
jehoshaphat the recit went on this is the mount of oliv this is
the hill of offens the nest of hut is the villag of siloam here
yonder everi where is the king garden under this great tree
zacharia the high priest was murder yonder is mount moriah and the
templ wall the tomb of absalom the tomb of st jame the tomb of
zacharia beyond are the garden of gethseman and the tomb of the
virgin mari here is the pool of siloam and

we said we would dismount and quench our thirst and rest we were
burn up with the heat we were fail under the accumul fatigu
of day and day of ceaseless march all were will

the pool is a deep wall ditch through which a clear stream of water
run that come from under jerusalem somewher and pass through the
fountain of the virgin or be suppli from it reach this place by
way of a tunnel of heavi masonri the famous pool look exact as it
look in solomon time no doubt and the same duski orient women
came down in their old orient way and carri off jar of the water on
their head just as they did three thousand year ago and just as they
will do fifti thousand year henc if ani of them are still left on
earth

we went away from there and stop at the fountain of the virgin but
the water was not good and there was no comfort or peac ani where on
account of the regiment of boy and girl and beggar that persecut us
all the time for bucksheesh the guid want us to give them some
money and we did it but when he went on to say that they were starv
to death we could not but feel that we had done a great sin in throw
obstacl in the way of such a desir consumm and so we tri to
collect it back but it could not be done

we enter the garden of gethseman and we visit the tomb of the
virgin both of which we had seen befor it is not meet that i should
speak of them now a more fit time will come

i can not speak now of the mount of oliv or it view of jerusalem the
dead sea and the mountain of moab nor of the damascus gate or the tree
that was plant by king godfrey of jerusalem one ought to feel
pleasant when he talk of these thing i can not say ani thing about
the stone column that project over jehoshaphat from the templ wall like
a cannon except that the moslem believ mahomet will sit astrid of it
when he come to judg the world it is a piti he could not judg it
from some roost of his own in mecca without trespass on our holi
ground close by is the golden gate in the templ walla gate that was
an eleg piec of sculptur in the time of the templ and is even so
yet from it in ancient time the jewish high priest turn loos the
scapegoat and let him flee to the wilder and bear away his
twelvemonth load of the sin of the peopl if they were to turn one
loos now he would not get as far as the garden of gethseman till
these miser vagabond here would gobbl him up favorit pilgrim
express sin and all they wouldnt care muttonchop and sin
is good enough live for them the moslem watch the golden gate with
a jealous eye and an anxious one for they have an honor tradit
that when it fall islam will fall and with it the ottoman empir
it did not griev me ani to notic that the old gate was get a
littl shaki

we are at home again we are exhaust the sun has roast us almost
we have full comfort in one reflect howev our experi in
europ have taught us that in time this fatigu will be forgotten the
heat will be forgotten the thirst the tiresom volubl of the guid
the persecut of the beggarsand then all that will be left will be
pleasant memori of jerusalem memori we shall call up with alway
increas interest as the year go by memori which some day will
becom all beauti when the last annoy that incumb them shall
have fade out of our mind never again to return schoolboy day are
no happier than the day of after life but we look back upon them
regret becaus we have forgotten our punish at school and how
we griev when our marbl were lost and our kite destroyedbecaus we
have forgotten all the sorrow and privat of that canon epoch and
rememb onli it orchard robberi it wooden sword pageant and it
fish holyday we are satisfi we can wait our reward will come
to us jerusalem and today experi will be an enchant memori a
year hencememori which money could not buy from us




chapter lv

we cast up the account it foot up pretti fair there was noth
more at jerusalem to be seen except the tradit hous of dive and
lazarus of the parabl the tomb of the king and those of the judg
the spot where they stone one of the discipl to death and behead
anoth the room and the tabl made celebr by the last supper the
figtre that jesus wither a number of histor place about
gethseman and the mount of oliv and fifteen or twenti other in
differ portion of the citi itself

we were approach the end human natur assert itself now
overwork and consequ exhaust began to have their natur effect
they began to master the energi and dull the ardor of the parti
perfect secur now against fail to accomplish ani detail of the
pilgrimag they felt like draw in advanc upon the holiday soon to be
place to their credit they grew a littl lazi they were late to
breakfast and sat long at dinner thirti or forti pilgrim had arriv
from the ship by the short rout and much swap of gossip had to be
indulg in and in hot afternoon they show a strong disposit to
lie on the cool divan in the hotel and smoke and talk about pleasant
experi of a month or so gone byfor even thus earli do episod of
travel which were sometim annoy sometim exasper and full as
often of no consequ at all when they transpir begin to rise abov
the dead level of monoton reminisc and becom shape landmark
in one memori the fogwhistl smother among a million of trifl
sound is not notic a block away in the citi but the sailor hear it
far at sea whither none of those thousand of trifl sound can reach
when one is in rome all the dome are alik but when he has gone away
twelv mile the citi fade utter from sight and leav st peter
swell abov the level plain like an anchor balloon when one is

place them all two month and two thousand mile behind him those that
were worthi of be rememb are promin and those that were realli
insignific have vanish this disposit to smoke and idl and
talk was not well it was plain that it must not be allow to gain
ground a divers must be tri or demor would ensu the
jordan jericho and the dead sea were suggest the remaind of
jerusalem must be left unvisit for a littl while the journey was
approv at onc new life stir in everi puls in the saddl
abroad on the plainssleep in bed bound onli by the horizon fanci
was at work with these thing in a moment it was pain to note how
readili these townbr men had taken to the free life of the camp and
the desert the nomad instinct is a human instinct it was born with
adam and transmit through the patriarch and after thirti centuri
of steadi effort civil has not educ it entir out of us
yet it has a charm which onc tast a man will yearn to tast again
the nomad instinct can not be educ out of an indian at all

the jordan journey be approv our dragoman was notifi

at nine in the morn the caravan was befor the hotel door and we were
at breakfast there was a commot about the place rumor of war and
bloodsh were fli everi where the lawless bedouin in the valley of
the jordan and the desert down by the dead sea were up in arm and were
go to destroy all comer they had had a battl with a troop of
turkish cavalri and defeat them sever men kill they had shut up
the inhabit of a villag and a turkish garrison in an old fort near
jericho and were besieg them they had march upon a camp of our
excursionist by the jordan and the pilgrim onli save their live by
steal away and fli to jerusalem under whip and spur in the dark
of the night anoth of our parti had been fire on from an ambush
and then attack in the open day shot were fire on both side
fortun there was no bloodsh we spoke with the veri pilgrim who
had fire one of the shot and learn from his own lip how in this
immin dead peril onli the cool courag of the pilgrim their
strength of number and impos display of war materi had save them
from utter destruct it was report that the consul had request
that no more of our pilgrim should go to the jordan while this state of
thing last and further that he was unwil that ani more should
go at least without an unusu strong militari guard here was
troubl but with the hors at the door and everi bodi awar of what
they were there for what would you have done acknowledg that you
were afraid and back shame out hard it would not be human
natur where there were so mani women you would have done as we did
said you were not afraid of a million bedouinsand made your will and
propos quiet to yourself to take up an unostentati posit in the
rear of the process

i think we must all have determin upon the same line of tactic for it
did seem as if we never would get to jericho i had a notori slow
hors but somehow i could not keep him in the rear to save my neck
he was forev turn up in the lead in such case i trembl a
littl and got down to fix my saddl but it was not of ani use the
other all got down to fix their saddl too i never saw such a time
with saddl it was the first time ani of them had got out of order in
three week and now they had all broken down at onc i tri walk
for exercisei had not had enough in jerusalem search for holi
place but it was a failur the whole mob were suffer for
exercis and it was not fifteen minut till they were all on foot and i
had the lead again it was veri discourag

this was all after we got beyond bethani we stop at the villag of
bethani an hour out from jerusalem they show us the tomb of lazarus
i had rather live in it than in ani hous in the town and they show
us also a larg fountain of lazarus  and in the centr of the villag
the ancient dwell of lazarus lazarus appear to have been a man of
properti the legend of the sunday school do him great injustic they
give one the impress that he was poor it is becaus they get him
confus with that lazarus who had no merit but his virtu and virtu
never has been as respect as money the hous of lazarus is a
threestori edific of stone masonri but the accumul rubbish of
age has buri all of it but the upper stori we took candl and
descend to the dismal celllik chamber where jesus sat at meat with
martha and mari and convers with them about their brother we could
not but look upon these old dingi apart with a more than common
interest

we had had a glimps from a mountain top of the dead sea lie like a
blue shield in the plain of the jordan and now we were march down a
close flame rug desol defil where no live creatur could
enjoy life except perhap a salamand it was such a dreari
repuls horribl solitud it was the wilderness where john
preach with camel hair about his loinsraiment enoughbut he never
could have got his locust and wild honey here we were mope along
down through this dread place everi man in the rear our guardstwo
gorgeous young arab sheik with cargo of sword gun pistol and
dagger on boardwer loaf ahead

bedouin 

everi man shrunk up and disappear in his cloth like a mudturtl
my first impuls was to dash forward and destroy the bedouin my second
was to dash to the rear to see if there were ani come in that
direct i act on the latter impuls so did all the other if
ani bedouin had approach us then from that point of the compass
they would have paid dear for their rash we all remark that
afterward there would have been scene of riot and bloodsh there
that no pen could describ i know that becaus each man told what he
would have done individu and such a medley of strang and
unheardof invent of cruelti you could not conceiv of one man
said he had calm made up his mind to perish where he stood if need
be but never yield an inch he was go to wait with dead patienc
till he could count the stripe upon the first bedouin jacket and
then count them and let him have it anoth was go to sit still
till the first lanc reach within an inch of his breast and then
dodg it and seiz it i forbear to tell what he was go to do to
that bedouin that own it it make my blood run cold to think of it
anoth was go to scalp such bedouin as fell to his share and take
his baldhead son of the desert home with him aliv for trophi
but the wildey pilgrim rhapsodist was silent his orb gleam with
a dead light but his lip move not anxieti grew and he was
question if he had got a bedouin what would he have done with him
shot him he smile a smile of grim contempt and shook his head
would he have stab him anoth shake would he have quarter him
flay him more shake oh horror what would he have done

eat him 

such was the aw sentenc that thunder from his lip what was
grammar to a desperado like that i was glad in my heart that i had been
spare these scene of malign carnag no bedouin attack our
terribl rear and none attack the front the newcom were onli a
reinforc of cadaver arab in shirt and bare leg sent far
ahead of us to brandish rusti gun and shout and brag and carri on like
lunat and thus scare away all band of maraud bedouin that might
lurk about our path what a shame it is that arm white christian must
travel under guard of vermin like this as a protect against the
prowl vagabond of the desertthos sanguinari outlaw who are alway
go to do someth desper but never do it i may as well mention
here that on our whole trip we saw no bedouin and had no more use for
an arab guard than we could have had for patent leather boot and white
kid glove the bedouin that attack the other parti of pilgrim so
fierc were provid for the occas by the arab guard of those
parti and ship from jerusalem for temporari servic as bedouin
they met togeth in full view of the pilgrim after the battl and
took lunch divid the bucksheesh extort in the season of danger and
then accompani the cavalcad home to the citi the nuisanc of an arab
guard is one which is creat by the sheik and the bedouin togeth
for mutual profit it is said and no doubt there is a good deal of truth
in it

we visit the fountain the prophet elisha sweeten it is sweet yet
where he remain some time and was fed by the raven

ancient jericho is not veri picturesqu as a ruin when joshua march
around it seven time some three thousand year ago and blew it down
with his trumpet he did the work so well and so complet that he
hard left enough of the citi to cast a shadow the curs pronounc
against the rebuild of it has never been remov one king hold
the curs in light estim made the attempt but was stricken sore
for his presumpt it site will alway remain unoccupi and yet it
is one of the veri best locat for a town we have seen in all
palestin

at two in the morn they rout us out of bedanoth piec of
unwarr crueltyanoth stupid effort of our dragoman to get ahead
of a rival it was not two hour to the jordan howev we were
dress and under way befor ani one thought of look to see what time
it was and so we drows on through the chill night air and dream of
camp fire warm bed and other comfort thing

there was no convers peopl do not talk when they are cold and
wretch and sleepi we nod in the saddl at time and woke up
with a start to find that the process had disappear in the gloom
then there was energi and attent to busi until it duski outlin
came in sight again occasion the order was pass in a low voic
down the line close upclos up bedouin lurk here everi where 
what an exquisit shudder it sent shiver along one spine

we reach the famous river befor four oclock and the night was so
black that we could have ridden into it without see it some of us
were in an unhappi frame of mind we wait and wait for daylight but
it did not come final we went away in the dark and slept an hour on
the ground in the bush and caught cold it was a cost nap on that
account but otherwis it was a pay invest becaus it brought
unconsci of the dreari minut and put us in a somewhat fitter
mood for a first glimps of the sacr river

with the first suspicion of dawn everi pilgrim took off his cloth and
wade into the dark torrent sing

on jordan stormi bank i stand
and cast a wist eye
to canaan fair and happi land
where my possess lie 

but they did not sing long the water was so fear cold that they
were oblig to stop sing and scamper out again then they stood on
the bank shiver and so chagrin and so griev that they merit
holiest compass becaus anoth dream anoth cherish hope had
fail they had promis themselv all along that they would cross the
jordan where the israelit cross it when they enter canaan from
their long pilgrimag in the desert they would cross where the twelv
stone were place in memori of that great event while they did it they
would pictur to themselv that vast armi of pilgrim march through
the cloven water bear the hallow ark of the coven and shout
hosannah and sing song of thanksgiv and prais each had
promis himself that he would be the first to cross they were at the
goal of their hope at last but the current was too swift the water was
too cold

it was then that jack did them a servic with that engag
reckless of consequ which is natur to youth and so proper and
so seem as well he went and led the way across the jordan and all
was happi again everi individu wade over then and stood upon
the further bank the water was not quit breast deep ani where if it
had been more we could hard have accomplish the feat for the strong
current would have swept us down the stream and we would have been
exhaust and drown befor reach a place where we could make a
land the main object compass the droop miser parti sat
down to wait for the sun again for all want to see the water as well
as feel it but it was too cold a pastim some can were fill from
the holi river some cane cut from it bank and then we mount and
rode reluct away to keep from freez to death so we saw the
jordan veri dim the thicket of bush that border it bank threw
their shadow across it shallow turbul water stormi  the hymn
make them which is rather a complimentari stretch of fanci and we
could not judg of the width of the stream by the eye we knew by our
wade experi howev that mani street in america are doubl as
wide as the jordan

daylight came soon after we got under way and in the cours of an hour
or two we reach the dead sea noth grow in the flat burn
desert around it but weed and the dead sea appl the poet say is
beauti to the eye but crumbl to ash and dust when you break it
such as we found were not handsom but they were bitter to the tast
they yield no dust it was becaus they were not ripe perhap

the desert and the barren hill gleam pain in the sun around the
dead sea and there is no pleasant thing or live creatur upon it or
about it border to cheer the eye it is a scorch arid repuls
solitud a silenc brood over the scene that is depress to the
spirit it make one think of funer and death

the dead sea is small it water are veri clear and it has a pebbl
bottom and is shallow for some distanc out from the shore it yield
quantiti of asphaltum fragment of it lie all about it bank this
stuff give the place someth of an unpleas smell

all our read had taught us to expect that the first plung into the
dead sea would be attend with distress resultsour bodi would
feel as if they were sudden pierc by million of redhot needl the
dread smart would continu for hour we might even look to be
blister from head to foot and suffer miser for mani day we were
disappoint our eight sprang in at the same time that anoth parti of
pilgrim did and nobodi scream onc none of them ever did complain
of ani thing more than a slight prick sensat in place where their
skin was abrad and then onli for a short time my face smart for a
coupl of hour but it was part becaus i got it bad sunburn
while i was bath and staid in so long that it becam plaster over
with salt

no the water did not blister us it did not cover us with a slimi ooz
and confer upon us an atroci fragranc it was not veri slimi and i
could not discov that we smelt realli ani wors than we have alway
smelt sinc we have been in palestin it was onli a differ kind of
smell but not conspicu on that account becaus we have a great deal
of varieti in that respect we didnt smell there on the jordan the
same as we do in jerusalem and we dont smell in jerusalem just as we
did in nazareth or tiberia or cesarea philippi or ani of those other
ruinous ancient town in galile no we chang all the time and
general for the wors we do our own wash

it was a funni bath we could not sink one could stretch himself at
full length on his back with his arm on his breast and all of his bodi
abov a line drawn from the corner of his jaw past the middl of his
side the middl of his leg and through his ancl bone would remain out
of water he could lift his head clear out if he chose no posit
can be retain long you lose your balanc and whirl over first on your
back and then on your face and so on you can lie comfort on your
back with your head out and your leg out from your knee down by
steadi yourself with your hand you can sit with your knee drawn
up to your chin and your arm clasp around them but you are bound to
turn over present becaus you are topheavi in that posit you can
stand up straight in water that is over your head and from the middl of
your breast upward you will not be wet but you can not remain so the
water will soon float your feet to the surfac you can not swim on your
back and make ani progress of ani consequ becaus your feet stick
away abov the surfac and there is noth to propel yourself with but
your heel if you swim on your face you kick up the water like a
sternwheel boat you make no headway a hors is so topheavi that he
can neither swim nor stand up in the dead sea he turn over on his side
at onc some of us bath for more than an hour and then came out
coat with salt till we shone like icicl we scrub it off with a
coars towel and rode off with a splendid brandnew smell though it was
one which was not ani more disagre than those we have been for
sever week enjoy it was the varieg villaini and novelti of it
that charm us salt crystal glitter in the sun about the shore of
the lake in place they coat the ground like a brilliant crust of ice

when i was a boy i somehow got the impress that the river jordan was
four thousand mile long and thirtyf mile wide it is onli nineti
mile long and so crook that a man doe not know which side of it he
is on half the time in go nineti mile it doe not get over more
than fifti mile of ground it is not ani wider than broadway in new
york

there is the sea of galile and this dead seaneith of them twenti
mile long or thirteen wide and yet when i was in sunday school i
thought they were sixti thousand mile in diamet

travel and experi mar the grandest pictur and rob us of the most
cherish tradit of our boyhood well let them go i have alreadi
seen the empir of king solomon diminish to the size of the state of
pennsylvania i suppos i can bear the reduct of the sea and the
river

we look everi where as we pass along but never saw grain or crystal
of lot wife it was a great disappoint for mani and mani a year
we had known her sad stori and taken that interest in her which
misfortun alway inspir but she was gone her picturesqu form no
longer loom abov the desert of the dead sea to remind the tourist of
the doom that fell upon the lost citi

i can not describ the hideous afternoon ride from the dead sea to mar
saba it oppress me yet to think of it the sun so pelt us that
the tear ran down our cheek onc or twice the ghast treeless
grassless breathless canon smother us as if we had been in an oven
the sun had posit weight to it i think not a man could sit erect
under it all droop low in the saddl john preach in this
wilder  it must have been exhaust work what a veri heaven the
messi tower and rampart of vast mar saba look to us when we caught a
first glimps of them

we staid at this great convent all night guest of the hospit
priest mar saba perch upon a crag a human nest stock high up
against a perpendicular mountain wall is a world of grand masonri that
rise terrac upon terrac away abov your head like the terrac and
retreat colonnad one see in fanci pictur of belshazzar feast
and the palac of the ancient pharaoh no other human dwell is
near it was found mani age ago by a holi reclus who live at first
in a cave in the rocka cave which is inclos in the convent wall
now and was rever shown to us by the priest this reclus by his
rigor tortur of his flesh his diet of bread and water his utter
withdraw from all societi and from the vaniti of the world and his
constant prayer and saint contempl of a skull inspir an
emul that brought about him mani discipl the precipic on the
opposit side of the canyon is well perfor with the small hole they
dug in the rock to live in the present occup of mar saba about
seventi in number are all hermit they wear a coars robe an ugli
brimless stovepip of a hat and go without shoe they eat noth
whatev but bread and salt they drink noth but water as long as
they live they can never go outsid the wall or look upon a womanfor
no woman is permit to enter mar saba upon ani pretext whatsoev

some of those men have been shut up there for thirti year in all that
dreari time they have not heard the laughter of a child or the bless
voic of a woman they have seen no human tear no human smile they
have known no human joy no wholesom human sorrow in their heart
are no memori of the past in their brain no dream of the futur
all that is lovabl beauti worthi they have put far away from them
against all thing that are pleasant to look upon and all sound that
are music to the ear they have bar their massiv door and rear
their relentless wall of stone forev they have banish the tender
grace of life and left onli the sap and skinni mockeri their lip
are lip that never kiss and never sing their heart are heart that
never hate and never love their breast are breast that never swell
with the sentiment i have a countri and a flag  they are dead men who
walk

i set down these first thought becaus they are naturalnot becaus
they are just or becaus it is right to set them down it is easi for
bookmak to say i thought so and so as i look upon such and such a
scenewhen the truth is they thought all those fine thing afterward
one first thought is not like to be strict accur yet it is no
crime to think it and none to write it down subject to modif by
later experi these hermit are dead men in sever respect but
not in all and it is not proper that think ill of them at first i
should go on do so or speak ill of them i should reiter the
word and stick to them no they treat us too kind for that there
is someth human about them somewher they knew we were foreign
and protest and not like to feel admir or much friendli
toward them but their larg chariti was abov consid such thing
they simpli saw in us men who were hungri and thirsti and tire and
that was suffici they open their door and gave us welcom they
ask no question and they made no selfright display of their
hospit they fish for no compliment they move quiet about
set the tabl for us make the bed and bring water to wash in
and paid no heed when we said it was wrong for them to do that when we
had men whose busi it was to perform such offic we fare most
comfort and sat late at dinner we walk all over the build
with the hermit afterward and then sat on the lofti battlement and
smoke while we enjoy the cool air the wild sceneri and the sunset
one or two chose cosi bedroom to sleep in but the nomad instinct
prompt the rest to sleep on the broad divan that extend around the
great hall becaus it seem like sleep out of door and so was more
cheeri and invit it was a royal rest we had

when we got up to breakfast in the morn we were new men for all
this hospit no strict charg was made we could give someth if
we chose we need give noth if we were poor or if we were stingi
the pauper and the miser are as free as ani in the cathol convent of
palestin i have been educ to enmiti toward everi thing that is
cathol and sometim in consequ of this i find it much easier to
discov cathol fault than cathol merit but there is one thing i
feel no disposit to overlook and no disposit to forget and that
is the honest gratitud i and all pilgrim owe to the convent father
in palestin their door are alway open and there is alway a welcom
for ani worthi man who come whether he come in rag or clad in purpl
the cathol convent are a priceless bless to the poor a pilgrim
without money whether he be a protest or a cathol can travel the
length and breadth of palestin and in the midst of her desert wast
find wholesom food and a clean bed everi night in these build
pilgrim in better circumst are often stricken down by the sun and
the fever of the countri and then their save refug is the convent
without these hospit retreat travel in palestin would be a
pleasur which none but the strongest men could dare to undertak our
parti pilgrim and all will alway be readi and alway will to
touch glass and drink health prosper and long life to the convent
father of palestin

so rest and refresh we fell into line and file away over the
barren mountain of judea and along rocki ridg and through steril
gorg where etern silenc and solitud reign even the scatter
group of arm shepherd we met the afternoon befor tend their
flock of longhair goat were want here we saw but two live
creatur they were gazell of softeyed notorieti they look
like veri young kid but they annihil distanc like an express
train i have not seen anim that move faster unless i might say it
of the antelop of our own great plain

at nine or ten in the morn we reach the plain of the shepherd and
stood in a wall garden of oliv where the shepherd were watch
their flock by night eighteen centuri ago when the multitud of
angel brought them the tide that the saviour was born a quarter of
a mile away was bethlehem of judea and the pilgrim took some of the
stone wall and hurri on

the plain of the shepherd is a desert pave with loos stone void of
veget glare in the fierc sun onli the music of the angel it
knew onc could charm it shrub and flower to life again and restor
it vanish beauti no less potent enchant could avail to work this
miracl

in the huge church of the nativ in bethlehem built fifteen hundr
year ago by the inveter st helena they took us below ground and
into a grotto cut in the live rock this was the manger where christ
was born a silver star set in the floor bear a latin inscript to
that effect it is polish with the kiss of mani generat of
worship pilgrim the grotto was trick out in the usual tasteless
style observ in all the holi place of palestin as in the church
of the holi sepulchr envi and uncharit were appar here the
priest and the member of the greek and latin church can not come by
the same corridor to kneel in the sacr birthplac of the redeem but
are compel to approach and retir by differ avenu lest they
quarrel and fight on this holiest ground on earth

i have no medit  suggest by this spot where the veri first
merri christma  was utter in all the world and from whenc the
friend of my childhood santa claus depart on his first journey to
gladden and continu to gladden roar firesid on wintri morn in
mani a distant land forev and forev i touch with rever finger
the actual spot where the infant jesus lay but i thinknoth

you can not think in this place ani more than you can in ani other in
palestin that would be like to inspir reflect beggar crippl
and monk compass you about and make you think onli of bucksheesh when
you would rather think of someth more in keep with the charact of
the spot

i was glad to get away and glad when we had walk through the grotto
where eusebius wrote and jerom fast and joseph prepar for the
flight into egypt and the dozen other distinguish grotto and knew
we were done the church of the nativ is almost as well pack with
exceed holi place as the church of the holi sepulchr itself they
even have in it a grotto wherein twenti thousand children were
slaughter by herod when he was seek the life of the infant saviour

we went to the milk grotto of coursea cavern where mari hid herself
for a while befor the flight into egypt it wall were black befor
she enter but in suckl the child a drop of her milk fell upon the
floor and instant chang the dark of the wall to it own snowi
hue we took mani littl fragment of stone from here becaus it is
well known in all the east that a barren woman hath need onli to touch
her lip to one of these and her fail will depart from her we took
mani specimen to the end that we might confer happi upon certain
household that we wot of

we got away from bethlehem and it troop of beggar and relicpeddl
in the afternoon and after spend some littl time at rachel tomb
hurri to jerusalem as fast as possibl i never was so glad to get
home again befor i never have enjoy rest as i have enjoy it dure
these last few hour the journey to the dead sea the jordan and
bethlehem was short but it was an exhaust one such roast heat
such oppress solitud and such dismal desol can not sure exist
elsewher on earth and such fatigu

the commonest sagac warn me that i ought to tell the customari
pleasant lie and say i tore myself reluct away from everi note
place in palestin everi bodi tell that but with as littl
ostent as i may i doubt the word of everi he who tell it i could
take a dread oath that i have never heard ani one of our forti
pilgrim say ani thing of the sort and they are as worthi and as
sincer devout as ani that come here they will say it when they get
home fast enough but whi should they not they do not wish to array
themselv against all the lamartin and grimes in the world it doe
not stand to reason that men are reluct to leav place where the veri
life is almost badger out of them by importun swarm of beggar and
peddler who hang in string to one sleev and coattail and shriek
and shout in his ear and horrifi his vision with the ghast sore and
malform they exhibit one is glad to get away i have heard
shameless peopl say they were glad to get away from ladi festiv
where they were importun to buy by bevi of love young ladi
transform those houri into duski hag and rag savag and replac
their round form with shrunken and knot distort their soft
hand with scar and hideous deform and the persuas music of
their voic with the discord din of a hate languag and then see
how much linger reluct to leav could be muster no it is the
neat thing to say you were reluct and then append the profound
thought that struggl for utter  in your brain but it is the
true thing to say you were not reluct and found it imposs to
think at allthough in good sooth it is not respect to say it and
not poetic either

we do not think in the holi place we think in bed afterward when
the glare and the nois and the confus are gone and in fanci we
revisit alon the solemn monument of the past and summon the phantom
pageant of an age that has pass away




chapter lvi

we visit all the holi place about jerusalem which we had left
unvisit when we journey to the jordan and then about three oclock
one afternoon we fell into process and march out at the state
damascus gate and the wall of jerusalem shut us out forev we paus
on the summit of a distant hill and took a final look and made a final
farewel to the vener citi which had been such a good home to us

for about four hour we travel down hill constant we follow a
narrow bridlepath which travers the bed of the mountain gorg and
when we could we got out of the way of the long train of laden camel
and ass and when we could not we suffer the miseri of be mash
up against perpendicular wall of rock and have our leg bruis by the
pass freight jack was caught two or three time and dan and moult
as often one hors had a heavi fall on the slipperi rock and the
other had narrow escap howev this was as good a road as we had
found in palestin and possibl even the best and so there was not much
grumbl

sometim in the glen we came upon luxuri orchard of fig
apricot pomegran and such thing but often the sceneri was
rug mountain verdureless and forbid here and there tower
were perch high up on accliv which seem almost inaccess
this fashion is as old as palestin itself and was adopt in ancient
time for secur against enemi

we cross the brook which furnish david the stone that kill goliah
and no doubt we look upon the veri ground whereon that note battl was
fought we pass by a picturesqu old gothic ruin whose stone pavement
had rung to the arm heel of mani a valor crusad and we rode
through a piec of countri which we were told onc knew samson as a
citizen

we staid all night with the good monk at the convent of ramleh and in
the morn got up and gallop the hors a good part of the distanc
from there to jaffa or joppa for the plain was as level as a floor and
free from stone and besid this was our last march in holi land
these two or three hour finish we and the tire hors could have
rest and sleep as long as we want it this was the plain of which
joshua spoke when he said sun stand thou still on gibeon and thou
moon in the valley of ajalon  as we drew near to jaffa the boy
spur up the hors and indulg in the excit of an actual race
an experi we had hard had sinc we race on donkey in the azor
island

we came final to the nobl grove of orangetre in which the orient
citi of jaffa lie buri we pass through the wall and rode again
down narrow street and among swarm of anim rag and saw other
sight and had other experi we had long been familiar with we
dismount for the last time and out in the of ride at anchor
we saw the ship i put an exclam point there becaus we felt one
when we saw the vessel the long pilgrimag was end and somehow we
seem to feel glad of it

for descript of jaffa see univers gazett  simon the tanner
former live here we went to his hous all the pilgrim visit simon
the tanner hous peter saw the vision of the beast let down in a
sheet when he lay upon the roof of simon the tanner hous it was from
jaffa that jonah sail when he was told to go and prophesi against
nineveh and no doubt it was not far from the town that the whale threw
him up when he discov that he had no ticket jonah was disobedi
and of a faultfind complain disposit and deserv to be
light spoken of almost the timber use in the construct of
solomon templ were float to jaffa in raft and the narrow open
in the reef through which they pass to the shore is not an inch wider
or a shade less danger to navig than it was then such is the
sleepi natur of the popul palestin onli good seaport has now and
alway had jaffa has a histori and a stir one it will not be
discov ani where in this book if the reader will call at the
circul librari and mention my name he will be furnish with book
which will afford him the fullest inform concern jaffa

so end the pilgrimag we ought to be glad that we did not make it for
the purpos of feast our eye upon fascin aspect of natur for
we should have been disappointedat least at this season of the year a
writer in life in the holi land observ

monoton and uninvit as much of the holi land will appear to
person accustom to the almost constant verdur of flower ampl
stream and vari surfac of our own countri we must rememb that
it aspect to the israelit after the weari march of forti year
through the desert must have been veri differ 

which all of us will freeli grant but it truli is monoton and
uninvit  and there is no suffici reason for describ it as be
otherwis

of all the land there are for dismal sceneri i think palestin must be
the princ the hill are barren they are dull of color they are
unpicturesqu in shape the valley are unsight desert fring with a
feebl veget that has an express about it of be sorrow and
despond the dead sea and the sea of galile sleep in the midst of a
vast stretch of hill and plain wherein the eye rest upon no pleasant
tint no strike object no soft pictur dream in a purpl haze or
mottl with the shadow of the cloud everi outlin is harsh everi
featur is distinct there is no perspectivedist work no
enchant here it is a hopeless dreari heartbroken land

small shred and patch of it must be veri beauti in the full flush
of spring howev and all the more beauti by contrast with the
farreach desol that surround them on everi side i would like
much to see the fring of the jordan in springtim and shechem
esdraelon ajalon and the border of galileebut even then these spot
would seem mere toy garden set at wide interv in the wast of a
limitless desol

palestin sit in sackcloth and ash over it brood the spell of a
curs that has wither it field and fetter it energi where
sodom and gomorrah rear their dome and tower that solemn sea now
flood the plain in whose bitter water no live thing existsov
whose waveless surfac the blister air hang motionless and dead
about whose border noth grow but weed and scatter tuft of
cane and that treacher fruit that promis refresh to parch
lip but turn to ash at the touch nazareth is forlorn about that
ford of jordan where the host of israel enter the promis land with
song of rejoic one find onli a squalid camp of fantast bedouin
of the desert jericho the accurs lie a molder ruin today even
as joshua miracl left it more than three thousand year ago bethlehem
and bethani in their poverti and their humili have noth about
them now to remind one that they onc knew the high honor of the
saviour presenc the hallow spot where the shepherd watch their
flock by night and where the angel sang peac on earth good will to
men is unten by ani live creatur and unbless by ani featur
that is pleasant to the eye renown jerusalem itself the stateliest
name in histori has lost all it ancient grandeur and is becom a
pauper villag the rich of solomon are no longer there to compel the
admir of visit orient queen the wonder templ which was
the pride and the glori of israel is gone and the ottoman crescent is
lift abov the spot where on that most memor day in the annal of
the world they rear the holi cross the note sea of galile where
roman fleet onc rode at anchor and the discipl of the saviour sail
in their ship was long ago desert by the devote of war and
commerc and it border are a silent wilder capernaum is a
shapeless ruin magdala is the home of beggar arab bethsaida and
chorazin have vanish from the earth and the desert places round
about them where thousand of men onc listen to the saviour voic
and ate the miracul bread sleep in the hush of a solitud that is
inhabit onli by bird of prey and skulk fox

palestin is desol and unlov and whi should it be otherwis can
the curs of the deiti beautifi a land

palestin is no more of this workday world it is sacr to poetri and
traditionit is dreamland




chapter lvii

it was worth a kingdom to be at sea again it was a relief to drop all
anxieti whatsoeveral question as to where we should go how long we
should stay whether it were worth while to go or not all anxieti
about the condit of the hors all such question as shall we ever
get to water  shall we ever lunch  ferguson how mani more million
mile have we got to creep under this aw sun befor we camp  it was
a relief to cast all these tortur littl anxieti far awayrop of
steel they were and everi one with a separ and distinct strain on it
and feel the temporari content that is born of the banish of
all care and respons we did not look at the compass we did not
care now where the ship went to so that she went out of sight of land
as quick as possibl when i travel again i wish to go in a pleasur
ship no amount of money could have purchas for us in a strang
vessel and among unfamiliar face the perfect satisfact and the sens
of be at home again which we experienc when we step on board the
quaker citi our own shipaft this wearisom pilgrimag it is a
someth we have felt alway when we return to her and a someth we
had no desir to sell

we took off our blue woollen shirt our spur and heavi boot our
sanguinari revolv and our buckskins pantaloon and got shave
and came out in christian costum onc more all but jack who chang
all other articl of his dress but clung to his travel pantaloon
they still preserv their ampl buckskin seat intact and so his short
pea jacket and his long thin leg assist to make him a picturesqu
object whenev he stood on the forecastl look abroad upon the ocean
over the bow at such time his father last injunct suggest
itself to me he said

jack my boy you are about to go among a brilliant compani of gentlemen
and ladi who are refin and cultiv and thorough accomplish
in the manner and custom of good societi listen to their
convers studi their habit of life and learn be polit and
oblig to all and consider toward everi one opinion fail
and prejudic command the just respect of all your fellowvoyag
even though you fail to win their friend regard and jackdont you
ever dare while you live appear in public on those deck in fair
weather in a costum unbecom your mother drawingroom 

it would have been worth ani price if the father of this hope youth
could have step on board some time and seen him stand high on the
forecastl pea jacket tassel red fez buckskin patch and all
placid contempl the oceana rare spectacl for ani bodi
drawingroom

after a pleasant voyag and a good rest we drew near to egypt and out of
the mellowest of sunset we saw the dome and minaret of alexandria rise
into view as soon as the anchor was down jack and i got a boat and
went ashor it was night by this time and the other passeng were
content to remain at home and visit ancient egypt after breakfast it
was the way they did at constantinopl they took a live interest in
new countri but their schoolboy impati had worn off and they had
learn that it was wisdom to take thing easi and go along comfort
these old countri do not go away in the night they stay till after
breakfast

when we reach the pier we found an armi of egyptian boy with donkey
no larger than themselv wait for passengersfor donkey are the
omnibus of egypt we prefer to walk but we could not have our own
way the boy crowd about us clamor around us and slew their
donkey exact across our path no matter which way we turn they
were goodnatur rascal and so were the donkey we mount and the
boy ran behind us and kept the donkey in a furious gallop as is the
fashion at damascus i believ i would rather ride a donkey than ani
beast in the world he goe brisk he put on no air he is docil
though opinion satan himself could not scare him and he is
convenientveri conveni when you are tire ride you can rest your
feet on the ground and let him gallop from under you

we found the hotel and secur room and were happi to know that the
princ of wale had stop there onc they had it everi where on
sign no other princ had stop there sinc till jack and i came
we went abroad through the town then and found it a citi of huge
commerci build and broad handsom street brilliant with
gaslight by night it was a sort of reminisc of pari but final
jack found an icecream saloon and that close investig for that
even the weather was veri hot it had been mani a day sinc jack had
seen icecream and so it was useless to talk of leav the saloon till
it shut up

in the morn the lost tribe of america came ashor and infest the
hotel and took possess of all the donkey and other open barouch
that offer they went in picturesqu process to the american
consul to the great garden to cleopatra needl to pompey
pillar to the palac of the viceroy of egypt to the nile to the superb
grove of datepalm one of our most inveter relichunt had his
hammer with him and tri to break a fragment off the upright needl and
could not do it he tri the prostrat one and fail he borrow a
heavi sledg hammer from a mason and tri again he tri pompey
pillar and this baffl him scatter all about the mighti monolith
were sphinx of nobl counten carv out of egyptian granit as
hard as blue steel and whose shape featur the wear of five thousand
year had fail to mark or mar the relichunt batter at these
persist and sweat profus over his work he might as well have
attempt to defac the moon they regard him seren with the
state smile they had worn so long and which seem to say peck away
poor insect we were not made to fear such as you in tenscor drag
age we have seen more of your kind than there are sand at your feet
have they left a blemish upon us 

but i am forget the jaffa colonist at jaffa we had taken on board
some forti member of a veri celebr communiti they were male and
femal babi young boy and young girl young marri peopl and
some who had pass a shade beyond the prime of life i refer to the
adam jaffa coloni  other had desert befor we left in jaffa mr
adam his wife and fifteen unfortun who not onli had no money but
did not know where to turn or whither to go such was the statement made
to us our forti were miser enough in the first place and they lay
about the deck seasick all the voyag which about complet their
miseri i take it howev one or two young men remain upright and
by constant persecut we worm out of them some littl inform
they gave it reluct and in a veri fragmentari condit for have
been shame humbug by their prophet they felt humili and
unhappi in such circumst peopl do not like to talk

the coloni was a complet fiasco i have alreadi said that such as could
get away did so from time to time the prophet adamsonc an actor
then sever other thing afterward a mormon and a missionari alway an
adventurerremain at jaffa with his hand of sorrow subject the
forti we brought away with us were chiefli destitut though not all of
them they wish to get to egypt what might becom of them then they
did not know and probabl did not careani thing to get away from hate
jaffa they had littl to hope for becaus after mani appeal to the
sympathi of new england made by stranger of boston through the
newspap and after the establish of an offic there for the
recept of money contribut for the jaffa colonist one dollar
was subscrib the consulgener for egypt show me the newspap
paragraph which mention the circumst and mention also the
discontinu of the effort and the close of the offic it was
evid that practic new england was not sorri to be rid of such
visionari and was not in the least inclin to hire ani bodi to bring
them back to her still to get to egypt was someth in the eye of
the unfortun colonist hopeless as the prospect seem of ever
get further

thus circumstanc they land at alexandria from our ship one of our
passeng mr mose s beach of the new york sun inquir of the
consulgener what it would cost to send these peopl to their home in
main by the way of liverpool and he said fifteen hundr dollar in
gold would do it mr beach gave his check for the money and so the
troubl of the jaffa colonist were at an end it was an unselfish
act of benevol it was done without ani ostent and has never
been mention in ani newspap i think therefor it is refresh to
learn now sever month after the abov narrat was written that
anoth man receiv all the credit of this rescu of the colonist
such is life 

alexandria was too much like a european citi to be novel and we soon
tire of it we took the car and came up here to ancient cairo which
is an orient citi and of the completest pattern there is littl about
it to disabus one mind of the error if he should take it into his head
that he was in the heart of arabia state camel and dromedari
swarthi egyptian and likewis turk and black ethiopian turban
sash and blaze in a rich varieti of orient costum of all shade
of flashi color are what one see on everi hand crowd the narrow
street and the honeycomb bazaar we are stop at shepherd
hotel which is the worst on earth except the one i stop at onc in a
small town in the unit state it is pleasant to read this sketch in
my notebook now and know that i can stand shepherd hotel sure
becaus i have been in one just like it in america and surviv

i stop at the benton hous it use to be a good hotel but that
prove nothingi use to be a good boy for that matter both of
us have lost charact of late year the benton is not a good
hotel the benton lack a veri great deal of be a good hotel
perdit is full of better hotel than the benton

it was late at night when i got there and i told the clerk i would
like plenti of light becaus i want to read an hour or two
when i reach no  with the porter we came along a dim hall that
was clad in ancient carpet fade worn out in mani place and
patch with old scrap of oil clotha hall that sank under one
feet and creak dismal to everi footstep he struck a light
 two inch of sallow sorrow consumpt tallow candl that
burn blue and sputter and got discourag and went out the
porter lit it again and i ask if that was all the light the clerk
sent he said oh no iv got anoth one here  and he produc
anoth coupl of inch of tallow candl i said light them both
ill have to have one to see the other by  he did it but the
result was drearier than dark itself he was a cheeri
accommod rascal he said he would go somewheres and steal a

and he went off growl to himself and still wonder and
wonder over the unaccount conduct of no  the lamp was a
good one but it reveal some disagre thingsa bed in the
suburb of a desert of rooma bed that had hill and valley in it
and youd have to accommod your bodi to the impress left in it

remot corner and a deject pitcher on it sorrow over a broken
nose a lookingglass split across the centr which chop your
head off at the chin and made you look like some dread unfinish
monster or other the paper peel in shred from the wall

i sigh and said this is charm and now dont you think you

and select one befor the choic anim are all taken




chapter lviii

the donkey were all good all handsom all strong and in good
condit all fast and all will to prove it they were the best we
had found ani where and the most recherch i do not know what
recherch is but that is what these donkey were anyhow some
were of a soft mousecolor and the other were white black and
varicolor some were closeshaven all over except that a tuft like
a paintbrush was left on the end of the tail other were so shaven in
fanci landscap garden pattern as to mark their bodi with curv
line which were bound on one side by hair and on the other by the
close plush left by the shear they had all been newli barber and
were exceed stylish sever of the white one were bar like
zebra with rainbow stripe of blue and red and yellow paint these
were indescrib gorgeous dan and jack select from this lot
becaus they brought back italian reminisc of the old master 
the saddl were the high stuffi frogshap thing we had known in
ephesus and smyrna the donkeyboy were live young egyptian rascal
who could follow a donkey and keep him in a canter half a day without
tire we had plenti of spectat when we mount for the hotel was
full of english peopl bound overland to india and offic get
readi for the african campaign against the abyssinian king theodorus
we were not a veri larg parti but as we charg through the street of
the great metropoli we made nois for five hundr and display
activ and creat excit in proport nobodi can steer a
donkey and some collid with camel dervish effendi ass
beggar and everi thing els that offer to the donkey a reason
chanc for a collis when we turn into the broad avenu that lead
out of the citi toward old cairo there was plenti of room the wall
of state datepalm that fenc the garden and border the way
threw their shadow down and made the air cool and brace we rose to
the spirit of the time and the race becam a wild rout a stamped a
terrif panic i wish to live to enjoy it again

somewher along this rout we had a few startl exhibit of orient
simplic a girl appar thirteen year of age came along the great
thoroughfar dress like eve befor the fall we would have call her
thirteen at home but here girl who look thirteen are often not more
than nine in realiti occasion we saw starknak men of superb
build bath and make no attempt at conceal howev an hour
acquaint with this cheer custom reconcil the pilgrim to it and
then it ceas to occas remark thus easili do even the most
startl novelti grow tame and spiritless to these sightsurfeit
wander

arriv at old cairo the campfollow took up the donkey and tumbl
them bodili aboard a small boat with a lateen sail and we follow and
got under way the deck was close pack with donkey and men the two
sailor had to climb over and under and through the wedg mass to work
the sail and the steersman had to crowd four or five donkey out of the
way when he wish to swing his tiller and put his helm harddown but
what were their troubl to us we had noth to do noth to do but
enjoy the trip noth to do but shove the donkey off our corn and
look at the charm sceneri of the nile

on the island at our right was the machin they call the nilomet a
stonecolumn whose busi it is to mark the rise of the river and
propheci whether it will reach onli thirtytwo feet and produc a famin
or whether it will proper flood the land at forti and produc plenti
or whether it will rise to fortythre and bring death and destruct to
flock and cropsbut how it doe all this they could not explain to us
so that we could understand on the same island is still shown the spot
where pharaoh daughter found mose in the bulrush near the spot we
sail from the holi famili dwelt when they sojourn in egypt till
herod should complet his slaughter of the innoc the same tree they
rest under when they first arriv was there a short time ago but the
viceroy of egypt sent it to the empress eugeni late he was just in
time otherwis our pilgrim would have had it

the nile at this point is muddi swift and turbid and doe not lack a
great deal of be as wide as the mississippi

we scrambl up the steep bank at the shabbi town of ghizeh mount the
donkey again and scamper away for four or five mile the rout lay
along a high embank which they say is to be the bed of a railway the
sultan mean to build for no other reason than that when the empress of
the french come to visit him she can go to the pyramid in comfort
this is true orient hospit i am veri glad it is our privileg to
have donkey instead of car

at the distanc of a few mile the pyramid rise abov the palm
look veri cleancut veri grand and impos and veri soft and filmi
as well they swam in a rich haze that took from them all suggest of
unfeel stone and made them seem onli the airi noth of a dream
structur which might blossom into tier of vagu arch or ornat
colonnad may be and chang and chang again into all grace form
of architectur while we look and then melt delici away and
blend with the tremul atmospher

at the end of the leve we left the mule and went in a sailboat across
an arm of the nile or an overflow and land where the sand of the
great sahara left their embank as straight as a wall along the
verg of the alluvi plain of the river a labori walk in the
flame sun brought us to the foot of the great pyramid of cheop it
was a fairi vision no longer it was a corrug unsight mountain of
stone each of it monstrous side was a wide stairway which rose
upward step abov step narrow as it went till it taper to a point
far aloft in the air insect men and womenpilgrim from the quaker
citywer creep about it dizzi perch and one littl black swarm
were wave postag stamp from the airi summithandkerchief will be
understood

of cours we were besieg by a rabbl of muscular egyptian and arab
who want the contract of drag us to the topal tourist are of
cours you could not hear your own voic for the din that was around you
of cours the sheik said they were the onli respons parti that
all contract must be made with them all money paid over to them and
none exact from us by ani but themselv alon of cours they
contract that the varlet who drag us up should not mention
bucksheesh onc for such is the usual routin of cours we contract
with them paid them were deliv into the hand of the dragger
drag up the pyramid and harri and bedevil for bucksheesh from
the foundat clear to the summit we paid it too for we were
purpos spread veri far apart over the vast side of the pyramid there
was no help near if we call and the hercules who drag us had a
way of ask sweet and flatter for bucksheesh which was
seduct and of look fierc and threaten to throw us down the
precipic which was persuas and convinc

each step be full as high as a dinnert there be veri veri
mani of the step an arab have hold of each of our arm and spring
upward from step to step and snatch us with them forc us to lift
our feet as high as our breast everi time and do it rapid and keep it
up till we were readi to faint who shall say it is not live
exhilar lacer musclestrain bonewrench and perfect
excruci and exhaust pastim climb the pyramid i beseech
the varlet not to twist all my joint asund i iter reiter
even swore to them that i did not wish to beat ani bodi to the top did
all i could to convinc them that if i got there the last of all i would
feel bless abov men and grate to them forev i beg them
pray them plead with them to let me stop and rest a momenton one
littl moment and they onli answer with some more fright spring
and an unenlist volunt behind open a bombard of determin
boost with his head which threaten to batter my whole polit
economi to wreck and ruin

twice for one minut they let me rest while they extort bucksheesh
and then continu their maniac flight up the pyramid they wish to
beat the other parti it was noth to them that i a stranger must
be sacrif upon the altar of their unholi ambit but in the midst
of sorrow joy bloom even in this dark hour i had a sweet consol
for i knew that except these mohammedan repent they would go straight
to perdit some day and they never repentthey never forsak their
pagan this thought calm me cheer me and i sank down limp and
exhaust upon the summit but happi so happi and seren within

on the one hand a mighti sea of yellow sand stretch away toward the
end of the earth solemn silent shorn of veget it solitud
uncheer by ani form of creatur life on the other the eden of egypt
was spread below usa broad green floor cloven by the sinuous river
dot with villag it vast distanc measur and mark by the
diminish statur of reced cluster of palm it lay asleep in an
enchant atmospher there was no sound no motion abov the
dateplum in the middl distanc swell a dome and pinnacl mass
glimmer through a tint exquisit mist away toward the horizon a
dozen shape pyramid watch over ruin memphi and at our feet the
bland impass sphynx look out upon the pictur from her throne in
the sand as placid and pensiv as she had look upon it like full
fifti lag centuri ago

we suffer tortur no pen can describ from the hungri appeal for
bucksheesh that gleam from arab eye and pour incess from arab
lip whi tri to call up the tradit of vanish egyptian grandeur
whi tri to fanci egypt follow dead rames to his tomb in the pyramid
or the long multitud of israel depart over the desert yonder whi
tri to think at all the thing was imposs one must bring his
medit cut and dri or els cut and dri them afterward

the tradit arab propos in the tradit way to run down
cheop cross the eighth of a mile of sand interven between it and the
tall pyramid of cephron ascend to cephron summit and return to us on
the top of cheopsal in nine minut by the watch and the whole
servic to be render for a singl dollar in the first flush of
irrit i said let the arab and his exploit go to the mischief
but stay the upper third of cephron was coat with dress marbl
smooth as glass a bless thought enter my brain he must infal
break his neck close the contract with dispatch i said and let him
go he start we watch he went bound down the vast broadsid
spring after spring like an ibex he grew small and smaller till he
becam a bob pigmi away down toward the bottomthen disappear
we turn and peer over the other sideforti secondseighti second
a hundredhappi he is dead alreadi two minutesand a quarter
there he goe  too trueit was too true he was veri small now
gradual but sure he overcam the level ground he began to spring
and climb again up up upat last he reach the smooth coatingnow
for it but he clung to it with toe and finger like a fli he
crawl this way and thataway to the right slant upwardaway to
the left still slant upwardand stood at last a black peg on the
summit and wave his pigmi scarf then he crept downward to the raw
step again then pick up his agil heel and flew we lost him
present but present again we saw him under us mount with
undiminish energi short he bound into our midst with a gallant
warwhoop time eight minut fortyon second he had won his
bone were intact it was a failur i reflect i said to myself he
is tire and must grow dizzi i will risk anoth dollar on him

he start again made the trip again slip on the smooth coat
i almost had him but an infam crevic save him he was with us
onc moreperfect sound time eight minut fortysix second

i said to dan lend me a dollari can beat this game yet 

wors and wors he won again time eight minut fortyeight
second i was out of all patienc now i was desper money was
no longer of ani consequ i said sirrah i will give you a hundr
dollar to jump off this pyramid head first if you do not like the
term name your bet i scorn to stand on expens now i will stay
right here and risk money on you as long as dan has got a cent 

i was in a fair way to win now for it was a dazzl opportun for an
arab he ponder a moment and would have done it i think but his
mother arriv then and interf her tear move mei never can
look upon the tear of woman with indifferenceand i said i would give
her a hundr to jump off too

but it was a failur the arab are too highpric in egypt they put
on air unbecom to such savag

we descend hot and out of humor the dragoman lit candl and we all
enter a hole near the base of the pyramid attend by a crazi rabbl
of arab who thrust their servic upon us uninvit they drag us up
a long inclin chute and drip candlegreas all over us this chute
was not more than twice as wide and high as a saratoga trunk and was
wall roof and floor with solid block of egyptian granit as wide
as a wardrob twice as thick and three time as long we kept on
climb through the oppress gloom till i thought we ought to be
near the top of the pyramid again and then came to the queen
chamber  and short to the chamber of the king these larg apart
were tomb the wall were built of monstrous mass of smooth
granit neat join togeth some of them were near as larg
squar as an ordinari parlor a great stone sarcophagus like a bathtub
stood in the centr of the king chamber around it were gather a
picturesqu group of arab savag and soil and tatter pilgrim who
held their candl aloft in the gloom while they chatter and the
wink blur of light shed a dim glori down upon one of the
irrepress mementoseek who was peck at the vener
sarcophagus with his sacrilegi hammer

we struggl out to the open air and the bright sunshin and for the
space of thirti minut receiv rag arab by coupl dozen and
platoon and paid them bucksheesh for servic they swore and prove by
each other that they had render but which we had not been awar of
beforeand as each parti was paid they drop into the rear of the
process and in due time arriv again with a newlyinv delinqu
list for liquid

we lunch in the shade of the pyramid and in the midst of this
encroach and unwelcom compani and then dan and jack and i start
away for a walk a howl swarm of beggar follow ussurround us
almost head us off a sheik in flow white bournous and gaudi
headgear was with them he want more bucksheesh but we had
adopt a new codeit was million for defens but not a cent for
bucksheesh i ask him if he could persuad the other to depart if we
paid him he said yesfor ten franc we accept the contract and
said

now persuad your vassal to fall back 

he swung his long staff round his head and three arab bit the dust he
caper among the mob like a veri maniac his blow fell like hail and
wherev one fell a subject went down we had to hurri to the rescu and
tell him it was onli necessari to damag them a littl he need not kill
them in two minut we were alon with the sheik and remain so
the persuas power of this illiter savag were remark

each side of the pyramid of cheop is about as long as the capitol at
washington or the sultan new palac on the bosporus and is longer
than the greatest depth of st peter at romewhich is to say that each
side of cheop extend seven hundr and some odd feet it is about
seventyf feet higher than the cross on st peter the first time i
ever went down the mississippi i thought the highest bluff on the river
between st loui and new orleansit was near selma missouriwa
probabl the highest mountain in the world it is four hundr and
thirteen feet high it still loom in my memori with undiminish
grandeur i can still see the tree and bush grow smaller and
smaller as i follow them up it huge slant with my eye till they
becam a featheri fring on the distant summit this symmetr pyramid
of cheopsthi solid mountain of stone rear by the patient hand of
menthi mighti tomb of a forgotten monarchdwarf my cherish
mountain for it is four hundr and eighti feet high in still earlier
year than those i have been recal holliday hill in our town was
to me the noblest work of god it appear to pierc the sky it was
near three hundr feet high in those day i ponder the subject
much but i never could understand whi it did not swath it summit with
neverfail cloud and crown it majest brow with everlast snow
i had heard that such was the custom of great mountain in other part of
the world i rememb how i work with anoth boy at odd afternoon
stolen from studi and paid for with stripe to undermin and start from
it bed an immens boulder that rest upon the edg of that hilltop i
rememb how one saturday afternoon we gave three hour of honest
effort to the task and saw at last that our reward was at hand i
rememb how we sat down then and wipe the perspir away and
wait to let a picnic parti get out of the way in the road belowand
then we start the boulder it was splendid it went crash down the
hillsid tear up sapl mow bush down like grass rip and
crush and smash everi thing in it pathetern splinter and
scatter a wood pile at the foot of the hill and then sprang from the
high bank clear over a dray in the roadth negro glanc up onc and
dodgedand the next second it made infinitesim mincemeat of a frame
coopershop and the cooper swarm out like bee then we said it was
perfect magnific and left becaus the cooper were start up
the hill to inquir

still that mountain prodigi as it was was noth to the pyramid of
cheop i could conjur up no comparison that would convey to my mind a
satisfactori comprehens of the magnitud of a pile of monstrous stone
that cover thirteen acr of ground and stretch upward four hundr
and eighti tiresom feet and so i gave it up and walk down to the
sphynx

after year of wait it was befor me at last the great face was so
sad so earnest so long so patient there was a digniti not of
earth in it mien and in it counten a benign such as never ani
thing human wore it was stone but it seem sentient if ever imag
of stone thought it was think it was look toward the verg of
the landscap yet look at nothingnoth but distanc and vacanc
it was look over and beyond everi thing of the present and far into
the past it was gaze out over the ocean of timeov line of
centurywav which further and further reced close nearer and
nearer togeth and blend at last into one unbroken tide away toward
the horizon of remot antiqu it was think of the war of depart
age of the empir it had seen creat and destroy of the nation
whose birth it had wit whose progress it had watch whose
annihil it had note of the joy and sorrow the life and death the
grandeur and decay of five thousand slow revolv year it was the
type of an attribut of manof a faculti of his heart and brain it was
memoryretrospectionwrought into visibl tangibl form all who know
what patho there is in memori of day that are accomplish and face
that have vanishedalbeit onli a trifl score of year gone bywil
have some appreci of the patho that dwell in these grave eye that
look so steadfast back upon the thing they knew befor histori was
bornbefor tradit had beingth that were and form that move
in a vagu era which even poetri and romanc scarc know ofand pass
one by one away and left the stoni dreamer solitari in the midst of a
strang new age and uncomprehend scene

the sphynx is grand in it loneli it is impos in it magnitud
it is impress in the mysteri that hang over it stori and there is
that in the overshadow majesti of this etern figur of stone with
it accus memori of the deed of all age which reveal to one
someth of what he shall feel when he shall stand at last in the aw
presenc of god

there are some thing which for the credit of america should be left
unsaid perhap but these veri thing happen sometim to be the veri
thing which for the real benefit of american ought to have promin
notic while we stood look a wart or an excresc of some kind
appear on the jaw of the sphynx we heard the familiar clink of a
hammer and understood the case at onc one of our well mean
reptilesi mean relichuntershad crawl up there and was tri to
break a specimen from the face of this the most majest creation the
hand of man has wrought but the great imag contempl the dead age
as calm as ever unconsci of the small insect that was fret at
it jaw egyptian granit that has defi the storm and earthquak of
all time has noth to fear from the tackhamm of ignor
excursionistshighwaymen like this specimen he fail in his
enterpris we sent a sheik to arrest him if he had the author or to
warn him if he had not that by the law of egypt the crime he was
attempt to commit was punish with imprison or the bastinado
then he desist and went away

the sphynx a hundr and twentyf feet long sixti feet high and a
hundr and two feet around the head if i rememb rightlycarv out
of one solid block of stone harder than ani iron the block must have
been as larg as the fifth avenu hotel befor the usual wast by the
necess of sculptur of a fourth or a half of the origin mass was
begun i onli set down these figur and these remark to suggest the
prodigi labor the carv of it so eleg so symmetr so
faultless must have cost this speci of stone is so hard that
figur cut in it remain sharp and unmar after exposur to the weather
for two or three thousand year now did it take a hundr year of
patient toil to carv the sphynx it seem probabl

the ship had to stay a week or more at gibraltar to take in coal for the
home voyag

it would be veri tiresom stay here and so four of us ran the
quarantin blockad and spent seven delight day in sevill cordova
cadiz and wander through the pleasant rural sceneri of andalusia the
garden of old spain the experi of that cheeri week were too vari
and numer for a short chapter and i have not room for a long one
therefor i shall leav them all out




chapter lx

ten or eleven oclock found us come down to breakfast one morn in
cadiz they told us the ship had been lie at anchor in the harbor two
or three hour it was time for us to bestir ourselv the ship could
wait onli a littl while becaus of the quarantin we were soon on
board and within the hour the white citi and the pleasant shore of
spain sank down behind the wave and pass out of sight we had seen no
land fade from view so regret

it had long ago been decid in a noisi public meet in the main cabin
that we could not go to lisbon becaus we must sure be quarantin
there we did everi thing by massmeet in the good old nation way
from swap off one empir for anoth on the programm of the voyag
down to complain of the cookeri and the scarciti of napkin i am
remind now of one of these complaint of the cookeri made by a
passeng the coffe had been steadili grow more and more execr
for the space of three week till at last it had ceas to be coffe
altogeth and had assum the natur of mere discolor waterso this
person said he said it was so weak that it was transpar an inch in
depth around the edg of the cup as he approach the tabl one morn
he saw the transpar edgebi mean of his extraordinari vision long
befor he got to his seat he went back and complain in a highhand
way to capt duncan he said the coffe was disgrac the captain
show his it seem toler good the incipi mutin was more
outrag than ever then at what he denounc as the partial shown
the captain tabl over the other tabl in the ship he flourish
back and got his cup and set it down triumphant and said

just tri that mixtur onc captain duncan 

he smelt ittast itsmil benignantlythen said

it is inferiorfor coffeebut it is pretti fair tea 

the humbl mutin smelt it tast it and return to his seat he
had made an egregi ass of himself befor the whole ship he did it no
more after that he took thing as they came that was me

the oldfashion shiplif had return now that we were no longer in
sight of land for day and day it continu just the same one day
be exact like anoth and to me everi one of them pleasant at
last we anchor in the open roadstead of funchal in the beauti
island we call the madeira

the mountain look surpass love clad as they were in live
green rib with lava ridg fleck with white cottag riven by
deep chasm purpl with shade the great slope dash with sunshin and
mottl with shadow flung from the drift squadron of the sky and
the superb pictur fit crown by tower peak whose front were
swept by the trail fring of the cloud

but we could not land we staid all day and look we abus the man
who invent quarantin we held half a dozen massmeet and cram
them full of interrupt speech motion that fell stillborn
amend that came to nought and resolut that die from sheer
exhaust in tri to get befor the hous at night we set sail

we averag four massmeet a week for the voyagew seem alway in
labor in this way and yet so often fallaci that whenev at long
interv we were safe deliv of a resolut it was caus for
public rejoic and we hoist the flag and fire a salut

day passedand night and then the beauti bermuda rose out of the
sea we enter the tortuous channel steam hither and thither among
the bright summer island and rest at last under the flag of england
and were welcom we were not a nightmar here where were civil
and intellig in place of spanish and italian superstit dirt and
dread of cholera a few day among the breezi grove the flower
garden the coral cave and the love vista of blue water that went
curv in and out disappear and anon again appear through jungl
wall of brilliant foliag restor the energi dull by long drows
on the ocean and fit us for our final cruiseour littl run of a
thousand mile to new yorkamericahom

we bade goodby to our friend the bermudian  as our programm hath
itth major of those we were most intim with were negroesand
court the great deep again i said the major we knew more negro
than white peopl becaus we had a deal of wash to be done but we
made some most excel friend among the white whom it will be a
pleasant duti to hold long in grate remembr

we sail and from that hour all idl ceas such anoth system of
overhaul general litter of cabin and pack of trunk we had not
seen sinc we let go the anchor in the harbor of beirout everi bodi was

and now came our first accid a passeng was run through a
gangway between deck one stormi night when he caught his foot in the
iron stapl of a door that had been heedless left off a hatchway and
the bone of his leg broke at the ancl it was our first serious
misfortun we had travel much more than twenti thousand mile by
land and sea in mani tri climat without a singl hurt without a
serious case of sick and without a death among five and sixti
passeng our good fortun had been wonder a sailor had jump
overboard at constantinopl one night and was seen no more but it was
suspect that his object was to desert and there was a slim chanc at
least that he reach the shore but the passeng list was complet
there was no name miss from the regist

at last one pleasant morn we steam up the harbor of new york all
on deck all dress in christian garbbi special order for there was a
latent disposit in some quarter to come out as turksand amid a
wave of handkerchief from welcom friend the glad pilgrim note
the shiver of the deck that told that ship and pier had join hand
again and the long strang cruis was over amen




chapter lxi

in this place i will print an articl which i wrote for the new york
herald the night we arriv i do it part becaus my contract with my
publish make it compulsori part becaus it is a proper toler
accur and exhaust sum up of the cruis of the ship and the
perform of the pilgrim in foreign land and part becaus some of
the passeng have abus me for write it and i wish the public to
see how thankless a task it is to put one self to troubl to glorifi
unappreci peopl i was charg with rush into print with
these compliment i did not rush i had written news letter to the
herald sometim but yet when i visit the offic that day i did not
say ani thing about write a valedictori i did go to the tribun
offic to see if such an articl was want becaus i belong on the
regular staff of that paper and it was simpli a duti to do it the
manag editor was absent and so i thought no more about it at night
when the herald request came for an articl i did not rush  in
fact i demur for a while becaus i did not feel like write
compliment then and therefor was afraid to speak of the cruis lest i
might be betray into use other than complimentari languag howev
i reflect that it would be a just and righteous thing to go down and
write a kind word for the hadjishadji are peopl who have made the
pilgrimagebecaus parti not interest could not do it so feel
as i a fellowhadji and so i pen the valedictori i have read it
and read it again and if there is a sentenc in it that is not fulsom
complimentari to captain ship and passeng i can not find it if it
is not a chapter that ani compani might be proud to have a bodi write
about them my judgment is fit for noth with these remark i
confid submit it to the unprejud judgment of the reader

return of the holi land excursioniststh stori of the cruis

to the editor of the herald

the steamer quaker citi has accomplish at last her extraordinari
voyag and return to her old pier at the foot of wall street
the expedit was a success in some respect in some it was not
origin it was advertis as a pleasur excurs  well
perhap it was a pleasur excurs but certain it did not look
like one certain it did not act like one ani bodi and everi
bodi notion of a pleasur excurs is that the parti to it will
of a necess be young and giddi and somewhat boister they
will danc a good deal sing a good deal make love but sermon
veri littl ani bodi and everi bodi notion of a well conduct
funer is that there must be a hears and a corps and chief
mourner and mourner by courtesi mani old peopl much solemn
no leviti and a prayer and a sermon withal threefourth of the
quaker citi passeng were between forti and seventi year of
age there was a picnic crowd for you it may be suppos that the
other fourth was compos of young girl but it was not it was
chiefli compos of rusti old bachelor and a child of six year
let us averag the age of the quaker citi pilgrim and set the
figur down as fifti year is ani man insan enough to imagin
that this picnic of patriarch sang made love danc laugh
told anecdot dealt in ungod leviti in my experi they
sin littl in these matter no doubt it was presum here at
home that these frolicsom veteran laugh and sang and romp all
day and day after day and kept up a noisi excit from one end
of the ship to the other and that they play blindman buff or
danc quadrill and waltz on moonlight even on the
quarterdeck and that at odd moment of unoccupi time they jot
a lacon item or two in the journal they open on such an
elabor plan when they left home and then skurri off to their
whist and euchr labor under the cabin lamp if these thing were
presum the presumpt was at fault the vener excursionist
were not gay and friski they play no blindman buff they
dealt not in whist they shirk not the irksom journal for ala
most of them were even write book they never romp they
talk but littl they never sang save in the night
prayermeet the pleasur ship was a synagogu and the pleasur
trip was a funer excurs without a corps there is noth
exhilar about a funer excurs without a corps a free
hearti laugh was a sound that was not heard often than onc in
seven day about those deck or in those cabin and when it was
heard it met with precious littl sympathi the excursionist
danc on three separ even long long ago it seem an
age quadrill of a singl set made up of three ladi and five
gentlemen the latter with handkerchief around their arm to
signifi their sex who time their feet to the solemn wheez of a
melodeon but even this melancholi orgi was vote to be sin and
danc was discontinu

the pilgrim play domino when too much josephus or robinson
holi land research or bookwrit made recreat necessari
 for domino is about as mild and sinless a game as ani in the
world perhap except alway the ineff insipid divers
they call croquet which is a game where you dont pocket ani ball
and dont carom on ani thing of ani consequ and when you are
done nobodi has to pay and there are no refresh to saw off
and consequ there isnt ani satisfact whatev about it
 they play domino till they were rest and then they
blackguard each other privat till prayertim when they were
not seasick they were uncommon prompt when the dinnergong
sound such was our daili life on board the shipsolemn
decorum dinner domino devot slander it was not live
enough for a pleasur trip but if we had onli had a corps it would
have made a nobl funer excurs it is all over now but when i
look back the idea of these vener fossil skip forth on a
six month picnic seem exquisit refresh the advertis
titl of the expeditionth grand holi land pleasur excursion
 was a misnom the grand holi land funer procession would have
been bettermuch better

wherev we went in europ asia or africa we made a sensat
and i suppos i may add creat a famin none of us had ever
been ani where befor we all hail from the interior travel was a
wild novelti to us and we conduct ourselv in accord with
the natur instinct that were in us and trammel ourselv with
no ceremoni no convent we alway took care to make it
understood that we were americansamerican when we found that a
good mani foreign had hard ever heard of america and that a
good mani more knew it onli as a barbar provinc away off
somewher that had late been at war with somebodi we piti the
ignor of the old world but abat no jot of our import
mani and mani a simpl communiti in the eastern hemispher will
rememb for year the incurs of the strang hord in the year of
our lord  that call themselv american and seem to
imagin in some unaccount way that they had a right to be proud
of it we general creat a famin part becaus the coffe on
the quaker citi was unendur and sometim the more substanti
fare was not strict first class and part becaus one natur
tire of sit long at the same board and eat from the same
dish

the peopl of those foreign countri are veri veri ignor they
look curious at the costum we had brought from the wild of
america they observ that we talk loud at tabl sometim
they notic that we look out for expens and got what we
conveni could out of a franc and wonder where in the
mischief we came from in pari they just simpli open their eye
and stare when we spoke to them in french we never did succeed in
make those idiot understand their own languag one of our
passeng said to a shopkeep in refer to a propos return
to buy a pair of glove allong restay trankeelmay be ve coom
moonday  and would you believ it that shopkeep a born
frenchman had to ask what it was that had been said sometim it
seem to me somehow that there must be a differ between
parisian french and quaker citi french

the peopl stare at us everi where and we stare at them we
general made them feel rather small too befor we got done with
them becaus we bore down on them with america great until we
crush them and yet we took kind to the manner and custom
and especi to the fashion of the various peopl we visit
when we left the azor we wore aw capot and use fine tooth
combssuccess when we came back from tangier in africa we
were top with fezz of the bloodiest hue hung with tassel like
an indian scalplock in franc and spain we attract some
attent in these costum in itali they natur took us for
distemp garibaldian and set a gunboat to look for ani thing
signific in our chang of uniform we made rome howl we could
have made ani place howl when we had all our cloth on we got no
fresh raiment in greecethey had but littl there of ani kind but
at constantinopl how we turn out turban scimetar fezz
horsepistol tunic sash baggi trowser yellow slippersoh
we were gorgeous the illustri dog of constantinopl bark
their under jaw off and even then fail to do us justic they
are all dead by this time they could not go through such a run of
busi as we gave them and surviv

and then we went to see the emperor of russia we just call on
him as comfort as if we had known him a centuri or so and when
we had finish our visit we varieg ourselv with select
from russian costum and sail away again more picturesqu than
ever in smyrna we pick up camel hair shawl and other dressi
thing from persia but in palestineah in palestineour splendid
career end they didnt wear ani cloth there to speak of we
were satisfi and stop we made no experi we did not
tri their costum but we astonish the nativ of that countri
we astonish them with such eccentr of dress as we could
muster we prowl through the holi land from cesarea philippi to
jerusalem and the dead sea a weird process of pilgrim gotten
up regardless of expens solemn gorgeous greenspectacl
drows under blue umbrella and astrid of a sorrier lot of
hors camel and ass than those that came out of noah ark
after eleven month of seasick and short ration if ever those
children of israel in palestin forget when gideon band went
through there from america they ought to be curs onc more and
finish it was the rarest spectacl that ever astound mortal
eye perhap

well we were at home in palestin it was easi to see that that
was the grand featur of the expedit we had care noth much
about europ we gallop through the louvr the pitti the
ufizzi the vaticanal the galleriesand through the pictur and
fresco church of venic napl and the cathedr of spain
some of us said that certain of the great work of the old master
were glorious creation of genius we found it out in the
guidebook though we got hold of the wrong pictur sometim and
the other said they were disgrac old daub we examin modern
and ancient statuari with a critic eye in florenc rome or ani
where we found it and prais it if we saw fit and if we didnt we
said we prefer the wooden indian in front of the cigar store of
america but the holi land brought out all our enthusiasm we fell
into raptur by the barren shore of galile we ponder at tabor
and at nazareth we explod into poetri over the question
loveli of esdraelon we medit at jezreel and samaria over
the missionari zeal of jehu we riotedfair riot among the holi
place of jerusalem we bath in jordan and the dead sea reckless
whether our accidentinsur polici were extrahazard or not
and brought away so mani jug of precious water from both place
that all the countri from jericho to the mountain of moab will
suffer from drouth this year i think yet the pilgrimag part of
the excurs was it pet featurether is no question about that
after dismal smileless palestin beauti egypt had few charm
for us we mere glanc at it and were readi for home

they wouldnt let us land at maltaquarantin they would not let
us land in sardinia nor at algier africa nor at malaga spain
nor cadiz nor at the madeira island so we got offend at all
foreign and turn our back upon them and came home i suppos
we onli stop at the bermuda becaus they were in the programm
we did not care ani thing about ani place at all we want to go
home homesick was abroad in the shipit was epidem if the
author of new york had known how bad we had it they would
have quarantin us here

the grand pilgrimag is over goodby to it and a pleasant memori
to it i am abl to say in all kind i bear no malic no
illwil toward ani individu that was connect with it either as
passeng or offic thing i did not like at all yesterday i like
veri well today now that i am at home and alway hereaft i
shall be abl to poke fun at the whole gang if the spirit so move
me to do without ever say a malici word the expedit
accomplish all that it programm promis that it should
accomplish and we ought all to be satisfi with the manag of
the matter certain byeby

mark twain


i call that complimentari it is complimentari and yet i never have
receiv a word of thank for it from the hadji on the contrari i speak
noth but the serious truth when i say that mani of them even took
except to the articl in endeavor to pleas them i slave over
that sketch for two hour and had my labor for my pain i never will
do a generous deed again




conclus

near one year has flown sinc this notabl pilgrimag was end and as
i sit here at home in san francisco think i am move to confess that
day by day the mass of my memori of the excurs have grown more and
more pleasant as the disagre incid of travel which encumb
them flit one by one out of my mindand now if the quaker citi were
weigh her anchor to sail away on the veri same cruis again noth
could gratifi me more than to be a passeng with the same captain and
even the same pilgrim the same sinner i was on excel term with
eight or nine of the excursionist they are my staunch friend yet and
was even on speak term with the rest of the sixtyf i have been
at sea quit enough to know that that was a veri good averag becaus a
long seavoyag not onli bring out all the mean trait one has and
exagger them but rais up other which he never suspect he
possess and even creat new one a twelv month voyag at sea
would make of an ordinari man a veri miracl of mean on the other
hand if a man has good qualiti the spirit seldom move him to exhibit
them on shipboard at least with ani sort of emphasi now i am
satisfi that our pilgrim are pleasant old peopl on shore i am also
satisfi that at sea on a second voyag they would be pleasant
somewhat than they were on our grand excurs and so i say without
hesit that i would be glad enough to sail with them again i could
at least enjoy life with my hand of old friend they could enjoy
life with their cliqu as wellpasseng invari divid up into
cliqu on all ship

and i will say here that i would rather travel with an excurs parti
of methuselah than have to be chang ship and comrad constant as
peopl do who travel in the ordinari way those latter are alway
griev over some other ship they have known and lost and over other
comrad whom diverg rout have separ from them they learn to
love a ship just in time to chang it for anoth and they becom
attach to a pleasant travel companion onli to lose him they have
that most dismal experi of be in a strang vessel among strang
peopl who care noth about them and of undergo the customari
bulli by strang offic and the insol of strang servant
repeat over and over again within the compass of everi month they
have also that other miseri of pack and unpack trunksof run
the distress gauntlet of customhousesof the anxieti attend
upon get a mass of baggag from point to point on land in safeti
i had rasher sail with a whole brigad of patriarch than suffer so
we never pack our trunk but twicewhen we sail from new york and
when we return to it whenev we made a land journey we estim
how mani day we should be gone and what amount of cloth we should
need figur it down to a mathemat niceti pack a valis or two
accord and left the trunk on board we chose our comrad from
among our old tri friend and start we were never depend upon
stranger for companionship we often had occas to piti american
whom we found travel drearili among stranger with no friend to
exchang pain and pleasur with whenev we were come back from a
land journey our eye sought one thing in the distanc firstth ship
and when we saw it ride at anchor with the flag apeak we felt as a
return wander feel when he see his home when we step on
board our care vanish our troubl were at an endfor the ship was
home to us we alway had the same familiar old stateroom to go to and
feel safe and at peac and comfort again

i have no fault to find with the manner in which our excurs was
conduct it programm was faith carri outa thing which
surpris me for great enterpris usual promis vast more than they
perform it would be well if such an excurs could be gotten up everi
year and the system regular inaugur travel is fatal to prejudic
bigotri and narrowminded and mani of our peopl need it sore on
these account broad wholesom charit view of men and thing can
not be acquir by veget in one littl corner of the earth all one
lifetim

the excurs is end and has pass to it place among the thing that
were but it vari scene and it manifold incid will linger
pleasant in our memori for mani a year to come alway on the wing
as we were and mere paus a moment to catch fit glimps of the
wonder of half a world we could not hope to receiv or retain vivid
impress of all it was our fortun to see yet our holyday flight has
not been in vainfor abov the confus of vagu recollect certain
of it best prize pictur lift themselv and will still continu
perfect in tint and outlin after their surround shall have fade
away

we shall rememb someth of pleasant franc and someth also of
pari though it flash upon us a splendid meteor and was gone again
we hard knew how or where we shall rememb alway how we saw
majest gibraltar glorifi with the rich color of a spanish sunset

our is a nobl old hous and stretch a long way back into antiqu
the earliest ancestor the twain have ani record of was a friend of the
famili by the name of higgin this was in the eleventh centuri when
our peopl were live in aberdeen counti of cork england whi it is
that our long line has ever sinc born the matern name except when
one of them now and then took a play refug in an alia to avert
foolish instead of higgin is a mysteri which none of us has ever
felt much desir to stir it is a kind of vagu pretti romanc and we
leav it alon all the old famili do that way

arthour twain was a man of consider note a solicitor on the highway
in william rufus time at about the age of thirti he went to one of
those fine old english place of resort call newgat to see about
someth and never return again while there he die sudden

augustus twain seem to have made someth of a stir about the year
 he was as full of fun as he could be and use to take his old
sabr and sharpen it up and get in a conveni place on a dark night
and stick it through peopl as they went by to see them jump he was a
born humorist but he got to go too far with it and the first time
he was found strip one of these parti the author remov one
end of him and put it up on a nice high place on templ bar where it
could contempl the peopl and have a good time he never like ani
situat so much or stuck to it so long

he wrote a beauti beauti hand and he could imit anybodi
hand so close that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to
see it he had infinit sport with his talent but by and by he took a
contract to break stone for a road and the rough of the work spoil
his hand still he enjoy life all the time he was in the stone
busi which with inconsider interv was some fortytwo year
in fact he die in har dure all those long year he gave such
satisfact that he never was through with one contract a week till
govern gave him anoth he was a perfect pet and he was alway a
favorit with his fellowartist and was a conspicu member of their
benevol secret societi call the chain gang he alway wore his
hair short had a prefer for stripe cloth and die lament by
the govern he was a sore loss to his countri for he was so
regular

some year later we have the illustri john morgan twain he came over
to this countri with columbus in  as a passeng he appear to
have been of a crusti uncomfort disposit he complain of the
food all the way over and was alway threaten to go ashor unless
there was a chang he want fresh shad hard a day pass over his
head that he did not go idl about the ship with his nose in the air
sneer about the command and say he did not believ columbus knew
where he was go to or had ever been there befor the memor cri
of land ho  thrill everi heart in the ship but his he gaze a while
through a piec of smoke glass at the pencil line lie on the distant
water and then said land be hang it a raft 

when this question passeng came on board the ship he brought
noth with him but an old newspap contain a handkerchief mark
b g  one cotton sock mark l w c  one woollen one mark d f 
and a nightshirt mark o m r  and yet dure the voyag he worri
more about his trunk  and gave himself more air about it than all
the rest of the passeng put togeth

if the ship was down by the head  and would got steer he would go and
move his trunk farther aft and then watch the effect if the
ship was bi the stern  he would suggest to columbus to detail some men
to shift that baggag  in storm he had to be gag becaus his
wail about his trunk made it imposs for the men to hear the
order the man doe not appear to have been open charg with ani
grave unbecom thing but it is note in the ship log as a curious
circumstance that albeit he brought his baggag on board the ship in a
newspap he took it ashor in four trunk a queenswar crate and a
coupl of champagn basket but when he came back insinu in an
insol swagger way that some of his thing were miss and was
go to search the other passeng baggag it was too much and they
threw him overboard they watch long and wonder for him to come
up but not even a bubbl rose on the quiet eb tide but while
everi one was most absorb in gaze over the side and the interest was
momentarili increas it was observ with constern that the
vessel was adrift and the anchor cabl hang limp from the bow then
in the ship dim and ancient log we find this quaint note

in time it was discouv yt ye troblesom passeng hadd
gonn down and got ye anchor and toke ye same and sold it to
ye dam sauvag from ye interior say yt he hadd found it
ye sonn of a ghun 

yet this ancestor had good and nobl instinct and it is with pride that
we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who ever
interest himself in the work of elev and civil our indian
he built a commodi jail and put up a gallow and to his die day he
claim with satisfact that he had had a more restrain and
elev influenc on the indian than ani other reform that ever
labor among them at this point the chronicl becom less frank and
chatti and close abrupt by say that the old voyag went to see
his gallow perform on the first white man ever hang in america and
while there receiv injuri which termin in his death

the great grandson of the reformer flourish in sixteen hundr and
someth and was known in our annal as the old admir  though in
histori he had other titl he was long in command of fleet of swift
vessel well arm and man and did great servic in hurri up
merchantmen vessel which he follow and kept his eagl eye on alway
made good fair time across the ocean but if a ship still loiter in
spite of all he could do his indign would grow till he could
contain himself no longerand then he would take that ship home where he
live and keep it there care expect the owner to come for it
but they never did and he would tri to get the idl and sloth out
of the sailor of that ship by compel them to take invigor
exercis and a bath he call it walk a plank  all the pupil
like it at ani rate they never found ani fault with it after tri
it when the owner were late come for their ship the admir alway
burn them so that the insur money should not be lost at last
this fine old tar was cut down in the ful of his year and honor
and to her die day his poor heartbroken widow believ that if he had
been cut down fifteen minut sooner he might have been resuscit

charl henri twain live dure the latter part of the seventeenth
centuri and was a zealous and distinguish missionari he convert
sixteen thousand south sea island and taught them that a dogtooth
necklac and a pair of spectacl was not enough cloth to come to
divin servic in his poor flock love him veri veri dear and when
his funer was over they got up in a bodi and came out of the
restaur with tear in their eye and say one to anoth that he
was a good tender missionari and they wish they had some more of him

pahgotowahwahpukketekeewi mightyhunterwithahogey twain
adorn the middl of the eighteenth centuri and aid gen braddock
with all his heart to resist the oppressor washington it was this
ancestor who fire seventeen time at our washington from behind a tree
so far the beauti romant narrat in the moral storybook is
correct but when that narrat goe on to say that at the seventeenth
round the awestricken savag said solemn that that man was be
reserv by the great spirit for some mighti mission and he dare not
lift his sacrilegi rifl against him again the narrat serious
impair the integr of histori what he did say was

it aint no hic no use at man so drunk he cant stan still
long enough for a man to hit him i hic i cant ford to fool away
ani more amnit on him 

that was whi he stop at the seventeenth round and it was a good
plain matteroffact reason too and one that easili commend itself to
us by the eloqu persuas flavor of probabl there is about it

i alway enjoy the storybook narrat but i felt a mar misgiv
that everi indian at braddock defeat who fire at a soldier a coupl of
time two easili grow to seventeen in a centuri and miss him
jump to the conclus that the great spirit was reserv that soldier
for some grand mission and so i somehow fear that the onli reason whi
washington case is rememb and the other forgotten is that in his
the propheci came true and in that of the other it didnt there are
not book enough on earth to contain the record of the propheci indian
and other unauthor parti have made but one may carri in his
overcoat pocket the record of all the propheci that have been
fulfil

i will remark here in pass that certain ancestor of mine are so
thorough well known in histori by their alias that i have not felt
it to be worth while to dwell upon them or even mention them in the
order of their birth among these may be mention richard brinsley
twain alia guy fawk john wentworth twain alia sixteenstr jack
william hogarth twain alia jack sheppard anania twain alia baron
munchausen john georg twain alia capt kydd and them there are
georg franci train tom pepper nebuchadnezzar and baalam assthey
all belong to our famili but to a branch of it somewhat distant
remov from the honor direct linein fact a collater branch
whose member chiefli differ from the ancient stock in that in order to
acquir the notorieti we have alway yearn and hunger for they have
got into a low way of go to jail instead of get hang

it is not well when write an autobiographi to follow your ancestri
down too close to your own timeit is safest to speak onli vagu of
your greatgrandfath and then skip from there to yourself which i now
do

i was born without teethand there richard iii had the advantag of me
but i was born without a humpback likewis and there i had the
advantag of him my parent were neither veri poor nor conspicu
honest

but now a thought occur to me my own histori would realli seem so tame
contrast with that of my ancestor that it is simpli wisdom to leav
it unwritten until i am hang if some other biographi i have read
had stop with the ancestri until a like event occur it would have
been a felicit thing for the read public how doe it strike you

the secret reveal

it was night still reign in the grand old feudal castl of
klugenstein the year  was draw to a close far away up in the
tallest of the castl tower a singl light glimmer a secret
council was be held there the stern old lord of klugenstein sat in
a chair of state medit present he said with a tender
accent

mi daughter 

a young man of nobl presenc clad from head to heel in knight mail
answer

speak father 

mi daughter the time is come for the reveal of the mysteri that hath
puzzl all your young life know then that it had it birth in the
matter which i shall now unfold my brother ulrich is the great duke of
brandenburgh our father on his deathb decre that if no son were
born to ulrich the success should pass to my hous provid a son
were born to me and further in case no son were born to either but
onli daughter then the success should pass to ulrich daughter
if she prove stainless if she did not my daughter should succeed
if she retain a blameless name and so i and my old wife here pray
fervent for the good boon of a son but the prayer was vain you were
born to us i was in despair i saw the mighti prize slip from my
grasp the splendid dream vanish away and i had been so hope
five year had ulrich live in wedlock and yet his wife had born no
heir of either sex

but hold  i said all is not lost  a save scheme had shot athwart
my brain you were born at midnight onli the leech the nurs and six
waitingwomen knew your sex i hang them everi one befor an hour had
sped next morn all the baroni went mad with rejoic over the
proclam that a son was born to klugenstein an heir to mighti
brandenburgh and well the secret has been kept your mother own
sister nurs your infanc and from that time forward we fear noth

when you were ten year old a daughter was born to ulrich we griev
but hope for good result from measl or physician or other natur
enemi of infanc but were alway disappoint she live she throve
heaven malison upon her but it is noth we are safe for
haha have we not a son and is not our son the futur duke our
wellbelov conrad is it not so for woman of eightandtwenti year
as you are my child none other name than that hath ever fallen to you

now it hath come to pass that age hath laid it hand upon my brother
and he wax feebl the care of state do tax him sore therefor he
will that you shall come to him and be alreadi dukein act though not
yet in name your servitor are readyyou journey forth tonight

now listen well rememb everi word i say there is a law as old as
germani that if ani woman sit for a singl instant in the great ducal
chair befor she hath been absolut crown in presenc of the peopl
she shall die so heed my word pretend humil pronounc your
judgment from the premier chair which stand at the foot of the
throne do this until you are crown and safe it is not like that
your sex will ever be discov but still it is the part of wisdom to
make all thing as safe as may be in this treacher earth life 

oh my father is it for this my life hath been a lie was it that i
might cheat my unoffend cousin of her right spare me father
spare your child 

what huzzi is this my reward for the august fortun my brain has
wrought for thee by the bone of my father this pule sentiment of
thine but ill accord with my humor

betak thee to the duke instant and bewar how thou meddlest with my
purpos 

let this suffic of the convers it is enough for us to know that
the prayer the entreati and the tear of the gentlenatur girl
avail noth they nor anyth could move the stout old lord of
klugenstein and so at last with a heavi heart the daughter saw the
castl gate close behind her and found herself ride away in the
dark surround by a knight array of arm vassal and a brave
follow of servant

the old baron sat silent for mani minut after his daughter departur
and then he turn to his sad wife and said

dame our matter seem speed fair it is full three month sinc i
sent the shrewd and handsom count detzin on his devilish mission to my
brother daughter constanc if he fail we are not wholli safe but if
he do succeed no power can bar our girl from be duchess een though
illfortun should decre she never should be duke 

mi heart is full of bode yet all may still be well 

tush woman leav the owl to croak to bed with ye and dream of
brandenburgh and grandeur

chapter iii

the plot thicken

few month drift by all men publish the prais of the young
conrad govern and extol the wisdom of his judgment the
merci of his sentenc and the modesti with which he bore himself
in his great offic the old duke soon gave everyth into his hand
and sat apart and listen with proud satisfact while his heir
deliv the decre of the crown from the seat of the premier
it seem plain that one so love and prais and honor of all men
as conrad was could not be otherwis than happi but strang enough
he was not for he saw with dismay that the princess constanc had begun
to love him the love of the rest of the world was happi fortun for
him but this was freight with danger and he saw moreov that the
delight duke had discov his daughter passion likewis and was
alreadi dream of a marriag everi day somewhat of the deep sad
that had been in the princess face fade away everi day hope and
anim beam brighter from her eye and by and by even vagrant smile
visit the face that had been so troubl

conrad was appal he bitter curs himself for have yield to
the instinct that had made him seek the companionship of one of his own
sex when he was new and a stranger in the palacewhen he was sorrow
and yearn for a sympathi such as onli women can give or feel he now
began to avoid his cousin but this onli made matter wors for
natur enough the more he avoid her the more she cast herself in
his way he marvel at this at first and next it startl him the
girl haunt him she hunt him she happen upon him at all time and
in all place in the night as well as in the day she seem singular
anxious there was sure a mysteri somewher

this could not go on forev all the world was talk about it the
duke was begin to look perplex poor conrad was becom a veri
ghost through dread and dire distress one day as he was emerg from a
privat anteroom attach to the pictur galleri constanc confront
him and seiz both his hand in her exclaim

oh whi do you avoid me what have i donewhat have i said to lose
your kind opinion of mefor sure i had it onc conrad do not
despis me but piti a tortur heart i cannotcannot hold the word
unspoken longer lest they kill mei love you conrad there despis
me if you must but they would be utter 

conrad was speechless constanc hesit a moment and then
misinterpret his silenc a wild glad flame in her eye and she
flung her arm about his neck and said

you relent you relent you can love meyou will love me oh say you
will my own my worship conrad 

conrad groan aloud a sick pallor overspread his counten and
he trembl like an aspen present in desper he thrust the poor
girl from him and cri

you know not what you ask it is forev and ever imposs  and then
he fled like a crimin and left the princess stupefi with amaz
a minut afterward she was cri and sob there and conrad was
cri and sob in his chamber both were in despair both save ruin
stare them in the face

by and by constanc rose slowli to her feet and move away say

to think that he was despis my love at the veri moment that i thought
it was melt his cruel heart i hate him he spurn medid this
manh spurn me from him like a dog 




chapter iv

the aw revel

time pass on a settl sad rest onc more upon the counten
of the good duke daughter she and conrad were seen togeth no more
now the duke griev at this but as the week wore away conrad
color came back to his cheek and his oldtim vivac to his eye and
he administ the govern with a clear and steadili ripen wisdom

present a strang whisper began to be heard about the palac it grew
louder it spread farther the gossip of the citi got holdof it it
swept the dukedom and this is what the whisper said

the ladi constanc hath given birth to a child 

when the lord of klugenstein heard it he swung his plume helmet thrice
around his head and shout

long live duke conrad for lo his crown is sure from this day
forward detzin has done his errand well and the good scoundrel shall
be reward 

and he spread the tide far and wide and for eightandforti hour no
soul in all the baroni but did danc and sing carous and illumin to
celebr the great event and all at proud and happi old klugenstein
expens




chapter v

the fright catastroph

the trial was at hand all the great lord and baron of brandenburgh
were assembl in the hall of justic in the ducal palac no space was
left unoccupi where there was room for a spectat to stand or sit
conrad clad in purpl and ermin sat in the premier chair and on
either side sat the great judg of the realm the old duke had stern
command that the trial of his daughter should proceed without favor
and then had taken to his bed brokenheart his day were number
poor conrad had beg as for his veri life that he might be spare the
miseri of sit in judgment upon his cousin crime but it did not
avail

the saddest heart in all that great assemblag was in conrad breast

the gladdest was in his father for unknown to his daughter conrad 
the old baron klugenstein was come and was among the crowd of nobl
triumphant in the swell fortun of his hous

after the herald had made due proclam and the other preliminari
had follow the vener lord chief justic said

prison stand forth 

the unhappi princess rose and stood unveil befor the vast multitud
the lord chief justic continu

most nobl ladi befor the great judg of this realm it hath been
charg and proven that out of holi wedlock your grace hath given birth
unto a child and by our ancient law the penalti is death except in
one sole conting whereof his grace the act duke our good lord
conrad will advertis you in his solemn sentenc now wherefor give
heed 

conrad stretch forth the reluct sceptr and in the selfsam moment
the woman heart beneath his robe yearn piti toward the doom
prison and the tear came into his eye he open his lip to speak
but the lord chief justic said quick

not there your grace not there it is not law to pronounc
judgment upon ani of the ducal line save from the ducal throne 

a shudder went to the heart of poor conrad and a tremor shook the iron
frame of his old father likewis conrad had not been crowneddar he
profan the throne he hesit and turn pale with fear but it must
be done wonder eye were alreadi upon him they would be suspici
eye if he hesit longer he ascend the throne present he
stretch forth the sceptr again and said

prison in the name of our sovereign lord ulrich duke of
brandenburgh i proceed to the solemn duti that hath devolv upon me
give heed to my word by the ancient law of the land except you
produc the partner of your guilt and deliv him up to the execution
you must sure die embrac this opportunitysav yourself while yet
you may name the father of your child 

a solemn hush fell upon the great courta silenc so profound that men
could hear their own heart beat then the princess slowli turn with
eye gleam with hate and point her finger straight at conrad
said

thou art the man 

an appal convict of his helpless hopeless peril struck a chill to
conrad heart like the chill of death itself what power on earth could
save him to disprov the charg he must reveal that he was a woman
and for an uncrown woman to sit in the ducal chair was death at one
and the same moment he and his grim old father swoon and fell to the
ground

the remaind of this thrill and event stori will not be found in
this or ani other public either now or at ani futur time 

the truth is i have got my hero or heroin into such a particular
close place that i do not see how i am ever go to get him or her
out of it againand therefor i will wash my hand of the whole
busi and leav that person to get out the best way that offersor

chapter i

my brother had just been appoint secretari of nevada territoryan
offic of such majesti that it concentr in itself the duti and
digniti of treasur comptrol secretari of state and act
governor in the governor absenc a salari of eighteen hundr dollar
a year and the titl of mr secretari  gave to the great posit an
air of wild and impos grandeur i was young and ignor and i
envi my brother i covet his distinct and his financi splendor
but particular and especi the long strang journey he was go to
make and the curious new world he was go to explor he was go to
travel i never had been away from home and that word travel had a
seduct charm for me pretti soon he would be hundr and hundr of
mile away on the great plain and desert and among the mountain of
the far west and would see buffalo and indian and prairi dog and
antelop and have all kind of adventur and may be get hang or
scalp and have ever such a fine time and write home and tell us all
about it and be a hero and he would see the gold mine and the silver
mine and mayb go about of an afternoon when his work was done and
pick up two or three pail of shine slug and nugget of gold and
silver on the hillsid and by and by he would becom veri rich and
return home by sea and be abl to talk as calm about san francisco and
the ocean and the isthmus as if it was noth of ani consequ to
have seen those marvel face to face what i suffer in contempl
his happi pen cannot describ and so when he offer me in cold
blood the sublim posit of privat secretari under him it appear
to me that the heaven and the earth pass away and the firmament was
roll togeth as a scroll i had noth more to desir my
content was complet

at the end of an hour or two i was readi for the journey not much
pack up was necessari becaus we were go in the overland stage
from the missouri frontier to nevada and passeng were onli allow a
small quantiti of baggag apiec there was no pacif railroad in those
fine time of ten or twelv year agonot a singl rail of it
i onli propos to stay in nevada three monthsi had no thought of
stay longer than that i meant to see all i could that was new and
strang and then hurri home to busi i littl thought that i would
not see the end of that threemonth pleasur excurs for six or seven
uncommon long year

i dream all night about indian desert and silver bar and in due
time next day we took ship at the st loui wharf on board a
steamboat bound up the missouri river

we were six day go from st loui to st jo a trip that was so
dull and sleepi and eventless that it has left no more impress on my
memori than if it durat had been six minut instead of that mani
day no record is left in my mind now concern it but a confus
jumbl of savagelook snag which we deliber walk over with
one wheel or the other and of reef which we but and but and then
retir from and climb over in some softer place and of sandbar
which we roost on occasion and rest and then got out our
crutch and spar over

in fact the boat might almost as well have gone to st jo by land for
she was walk most of the time anyhowclimb over reef and
clamber over snag patient and labori all day long the
captain said she was a bully boat and all she want was more shear
and a bigger wheel i thought she want a pair of stilt but i had the
deep sagac not to say so




chapter ii

the first thing we did on that glad even that land us at st joseph
was to hunt up the stageoffic and pay a hundr and fifti dollar
apiec for ticket per overland coach to carson citi nevada

the next morn bright and earli we took a hasti breakfast and
hurri to the startingplac then an inconveni present itself
which we had not proper appreci befor name that one cannot
make a heavi travel trunk stand for twentyf pound of baggag
becaus it weigh a good deal more but that was all we could take
twentyf pound each so we had to snatch our trunk open and make a
select in a good deal of a hurri we put our law twentyf
pound apiec all in one valis and ship the trunk back to st loui
again it was a sad part for now we had no swallowtail coat and
white kid glove to wear at pawne recept in the rocki mountain and
no stovepip hat nor patentleath boot nor anyth els necessari
to make life calm and peac we were reduc to a warfoot each
of us put on a rough heavi suit of cloth woolen armi shirt and
stogy boot includ and into the valis we crowd a few white
shirt some undercloth and such thing my brother the secretari
took along about four pound of unit state statut and six pound of
unabridg dictionari for we did not knowpoor innocentsthat such
thing could be bought in san francisco on one day and receiv in carson
citi the next i was arm to the teeth with a piti littl smith 
wesson sevenshoot which carri a ball like a homoeopath pill
and it took the whole seven to make a dose for an adult but i thought
it was grand it appear to me to be a danger weapon it onli had
one faultyou could not hit anyth with it one of our conductors
practic awhil on a cow with it and as long as she stood still and
behav herself she was safe but as soon as she went to move about
and he got to shoot at other thing she came to grief the secretari
had a smallsiz colt revolv strap around him for protect
against the indian and to guard against accid he carri it
uncap mr georg bemi was dismal formid georg bemi was
our fellowtravel

we had never seen him befor he wore in his belt an old origin
allen revolv such as irrever peopl call a pepperbox  simpli
draw the trigger back cock and fire the pistol as the trigger
came back the hammer would begin to rise and the barrel to turn over
and present down would drop the hammer and away would speed the ball
to aim along the turn barrel and hit the thing aim at was a feat
which was probabl never done with an allen in the world but georg
was a reliabl weapon nevertheless becaus as one of the stagedriv
afterward said if she didnt get what she went after she would fetch
someth els  and so she did she went after a deuc of spade nail
against a tree onc and fetch a mule stand about thirti yard to
the left of it bemi did not want the mule but the owner came out with
a doublebarrel shotgun and persuad him to buy it anyhow it was a
cheer weaponth allen  sometim all it six barrel would go off
at onc and then there was no safe place in all the region round about
but behind it

we took two or three blanket for protect against frosti weather in
the mountain in the matter of luxuri we were modestw took none
along but some pipe and five pound of smoke tobacco we had two
larg canteen to carri water in between station on the plain and we
also took with us a littl shotbag of silver coin for daili expens in
the way of breakfast and dinner

by eight oclock everyth was readi and we were on the other side of
the river we jump into the stage the driver crack his whip and we
bowl away and left the states behind us it was a superb summer
morn and all the landscap was brilliant with sunshin there was a
fresh and breezi too and an exhilar sens of emancip
from all sort of care and respons that almost made us feel
that the year we had spent in the close hot citi toil and slave
had been wast and thrown away we were spin along through kansa
and in the cours of an hour and a half we were fair abroad on the
great plain just here the land was rollinga grand sweep of regular
elev and depress as far as the eye could reachlik the
state heav and swell of the ocean bosom after a storm and
everywher were cornfield accent with squar of deeper green this
limitless expans of grassi land but present this sea upon dri ground
was to lose it rolling charact and stretch away for seven hundr
mile as level as a floor

our coach was a great swing and sway stage of the most sumptuous
descriptionan impos cradl on wheel it was drawn by six handsom
hors and by the side of the driver sat the conductor  the legitim
captain of the craft for it was his busi to take charg and care of
the mail baggag express matter and passeng we three were the
onli passeng this trip we sat on the back seat insid about all
the rest of the coach was full of mail bagsfor we had three day
delay mail with us almost touch our knee a perpendicular wall
of mail matter rose up to the roof there was a great pile of it
strap on top of the stage and both the fore and hind boot were full
we had twentyseven hundr pound of it aboard the driver saida
littl for brigham and carson and frisco but the heft of it for the
injun which is power troublesom thout they get plenti of truck to
read  but as he just then got up a fear convuls of his counten
which was suggest of a wink be swallow by an earthquak we
guess that his remark was intend to be faceti and to mean that we
would unload the most of our mail matter somewher on the plain and
leav it to the indian or whosoev want it

we chang hors everi ten mile all day long and fair flew over the
hard level road we jump out and stretch our leg everi time the
coach stop and so the night found us still vivaci and unfatigu

after supper a woman got in who live about fifti mile further on and
we three had to take turn at sit outsid with the driver and
conductor appar she was not a talkat woman she would sit
there in the gather twilight and fasten her steadfast eye on a
mosquito root into her arm and slowli she would rais her other hand
till she had got his rang and then she would launch a slap at him that
would have jolt a cow and after that she would sit and contempl the
corps with tranquil satisfactionfor she never miss her mosquito she
was a dead shot at short rang she never remov a carcas but left
them there for bait i sat by this grim sphynx and watch her kill
thirti or forti mosquitoeswatch her and wait for her to say
someth but she never did so i final open the convers
myself i said

the mosquito are pretti bad about here madam 

you bet 

what did i understand you to say madam 

you bet 

then she cheer up and face around and said

dang if i didnt begin to think you feller was deef and dumb i did
bgosh here iv sot and sot and sot abustn muskeet and
wonderin what was ailin ye fust i thot you was deef and dumb then i
thot you was sick or crazi or suthin and then by and by i begin to
reckon you was a passel of sick fool that couldnt think of noth to
say wherd ye come from 

the sphynx was a sphynx no more the fountain of her great deep were
broken up and she rain the nine part of speech forti day and forti
night metaphor speak and buri us under a desol delug
of trivial gossip that left not a crag or pinnacl of rejoind
project abov the toss wast of disloc grammar and decompos
pronunci

how we suffer suffer suffer she went on hour after hour till
i was sorri i ever open the mosquito question and gave her a start
she never did stop again until she got to her journey end toward
daylight and then she stir us up as she was leav the stage for we
were nod by that time and said

now you git out at cottonwood you feller and lay over a coupl o
day and ill be along some time tonight and if i can do ye ani good
by edgin in a word now and then im right thar folksll tell yout
iv alway ben kind o offish and particlar for a gal that rais in
the wood and i am with the ragtag and bobtail and a gal has to be
if she want to be anyth but when peopl come along which is my
equal i reckon im a pretti sociabl heifer after all 

we resolv not to lay by at cottonwood 




chapter iii

about an hour and a half befor daylight we were bowl along smooth
over the roadso smooth that our cradl onli rock in a gentl
lull way that was gradual sooth us to sleep and dull our
consciousnesswhen someth gave away under us we were dim awar of
it but indiffer to it the coach stop we heard the driver and
conductor talk togeth outsid and rummag for a lantern and
swear becaus they could not find itbut we had no interest in
whatev had happen and it onli ad to our comfort to think of those
peopl out there at work in the murki night and we snug in our nest with
the curtain drawn but present by the sound there seem to be an
examin go on and then the driver voic said

bi georg the thoroughbrac is broke 

this startl me broad awakea an undefin sens of calam is alway
apt to do i said to myself now a thoroughbrac is probabl part of a
hors and doubtless a vital part too from the dismay in the driver
voic leg maybeand yet how could he break his leg waltz along
such a road as this no it cant be his leg that is imposs
unless he was reach for the driver now what can be the
thoroughbrac of a hors i wonder well whatev come i shall not
air my ignor in this crowd anyway 

just then the conductor face appear at a lift curtain and his
lantern glare in on us and our wall of mail matter he said
gent youll have to turn out a spell thoroughbrac is broke 

we climb out into a chill drizzl and felt ever so homeless and
dreari when i found that the thing they call a thoroughbrace was
the massiv combin of belt and spring which the coach rock itself
in i said to the driver

i never saw a thoroughbrac use up like that befor that i can
rememb how did it happen 

whi it happen by tri to make one coach carri three day mail
that how it happen  said he and right here is the veri direct
which is wrote on all the newspaperbag which was to be put out for the
injun for to keep em quiet it most uncommon lucki becuz it so
nation dark i should a gone by unbeknown if that air thoroughbrac
hadnt broke 

i knew that he was in labor with anoth of those wink of his though i
could not see his face becaus he was bent down at work and wish him
a safe deliveri i turn to and help the rest get out the mailsack
it made a great pyramid by the roadsid when it was all out when they
had mend the thoroughbrac we fill the two boot again but put no
mail on top and onli half as much insid as there was befor the
conductor bent all the seatback down and then fill the coach just
half full of mailbag from end to end we object loud to this for
it left us no seat but the conductor was wiser than we and said a bed
was better than seat and moreov this plan would protect his
thoroughbrac we never want ani seat after that the lazi bed was
infinit prefer i had mani an excit day subsequ lie
on it read the statut and the dictionari and wonder how the
charact would turn out

the conductor said he would send back a guard from the next station to
take charg of the abandon mailbag and we drove on

it was now just dawn and as we stretch our cramp leg full length on
the mail sack and gaze out through the window across the wide wast
of greensward clad in cool powderi mist to where there was an expect
look in the eastern horizon our perfect enjoy took the form of a
tranquil and content ecstasi the stage whirl along at a spank
gait the breez flap curtain and suspend coat in a most
exhilar way the cradl sway and swung luxuri the patter
of the hors hoof the crack of the driver whip and his hiyi
glang  were music the spin ground and the waltz tree appear
to give us a mute hurrah as we went by and then slack up and look after
us with interest or envi or someth and as we lay and smoke the
pipe of peac and compar all this luxuri with the year of tiresom
citi life that had gone befor it we felt that there was onli one
complet and satisfi happi in the world and we had found it

after breakfast at some station whose name i have forgotten we three
climb up on the seat behind the driver and let the conductor have our
bed for a nap and by and by when the sun made me drowsi i lay down on
my face on top of the coach grasp the slender iron rail and slept
for an hour or more that will give one an appreci idea of those
matchless road instinct will make a sleep man grip a fast hold of
the rail when the stage jolt but when it onli swing and sway no
grip is necessari overland driver and conductor use to sit in their
place and sleep thirti or forti minut at a time on good road while
spin along at the rate of eight or ten mile an hour i saw them do
it often there was no danger about it a sleep man will seiz the
iron in time when the coach jolt these men were hard work and it
was not possibl for them to stay awak all the time

by and by we pass through marysvill and over the big blue and littl
sandi thenc about a mile and enter nebraska about a mile further
on we came to the big sandyon hundr and eighti mile from st
joseph

as the sun was go down we saw the first specimen of an anim known
familiar over two thousand mile of mountain and desertfrom kansa
clear to the pacif oceana the jackass rabbit  he is well name
he is just like ani other rabbit except that he is from one third to
twice as larg has longer leg in proport to his size and has the
most preposter ear that ever were mount on ani creatur but a
jackass

when he is sit quiet think about his sin or is absentmind or
unapprehens of danger his majest ear project abov him
conspicu but the break of a twig will scare him near to death
and then he tilt his ear back gentl and start for home all you can
see then for the next minut is his long gray form stretch out
straight and streak it through the low sagebrush head erect eye
right and ear just cant a littl to the rear but show you where
the anim is all the time the same as if he carri a jib now and
then he make a marvel spring with his long leg high over the
stunt sagebrush and score a leap that would make a hors envious
present he come down to a long grace lope  and short he
mysteri disappear he has crouch behind a sagebush and will
sit there and listen and trembl until you get within six feet of him
when he will get under way again but one must shoot at this creatur
onc if he wish to see him throw his heart into his heel and do the
best he know how he is frighten clear through now and he lay his
long ear down on his back straighten himself out like a yardstick
everi spring he make and scatter mile behind him with an easi
indiffer that is enchant

our parti made this specimen hump himself  as the conductor said the
secretari start him with a shot from the colt i commenc spit at
him with my weapon and all in the same instant the old allens whole
broadsid let go with a rattl crash and it is not put it too
strong to say that the rabbit was frantic he drop his ear set up
his tail and left for san francisco at a speed which can onli be
describ as a flash and a vanish long after he was out of sight we
could hear him whiz

i do not rememb where we first came across sagebrush  but as i have
been speak of it i may as well describ it

this is easili done for if the reader can imagin a gnarl and
vener live oaktre reduc to a littl shrub two feethigh with it
rough bark it foliag it twist bough all complet he can pictur
the sagebrush exact often on lazi afternoon in the mountain i
have lain on the ground with my face under a sagebush and entertain
myself with fanci that the gnat among it foliag were liliputian
bird and that the ant march and countermarch about it base were
liliputian flock and herd and myself some vast loafer from brobdignag
wait to catch a littl citizen and eat him

it is an impos monarch of the forest in exquisit miniatur is the
sagebrush  it foliag is a grayish green and give that tint to
desert and mountain it smell like our domest sage and sagetea
made from it tast like the sagetea which all boy are so well
acquaint with the sagebrush is a singular hardi plant and grow
right in the midst of deep sand and among barren rock where noth
els in the veget world would tri to grow except bunchgrass 
bunchgrass grow on the bleak mountainsid of nevada and
neighbor territori and offer excel feed for stock even in the
dead of winter wherev the snow is blown asid and expos it
notwithstand it unpromis home bunchgrass is a better and more
nutriti diet for cattl and hors than almost ani other hay or grass
that is knownso stockmen say the sagebush grow from three to
six or seven feet apart all over the mountain and desert of the far
west clear to the border of california there is not a tree of ani
kind in the desert for hundr of milesther is no veget at all
in a regular desert except the sagebrush and it cousin the
greasewood  which is so much like the sagebrush that the differ
amount to littl campfir and hot supper in the desert would be
imposs but for the friend sagebrush it trunk is as larg as a
boy wrist and from that up to a man arm and it crook branch
are half as larg as it trunkal good sound hard wood veri like
oak

when a parti camp the first thing to be done is to cut sagebrush and
in a few minut there is an opul pile of it readi for use a hole a
foot wide two feet deep and two feet long is dug and sagebrush
chop up and burn in it till it is full to the brim with glow
coal then the cook begin and there is no smoke and consequ
no swear such a fire will keep all night with veri littl
replenish and it make a veri sociabl campfir and one around
which the most imposs reminisc sound plausibl instruct and
profound entertain

sagebrush is veri fair fuel but as a veget it is a distinguish
failur noth can abid the tast of it but the jackass and his
illegitim child the mule but their testimoni to it nutriti
is worth noth for they will eat pine knot or anthracit coal or
brass file or lead pipe or old bottl or anyth that come
handi and then go off look as grate as if they had had oyster for
dinner mule and donkey and camel have appetit that anyth will
reliev temporarili but noth satisfi

in syria onc at the headwat of the jordan a camel took charg of
my overcoat while the tent were be pitch and examin it with a
critic eye all over with as much interest as if he had an idea of
get one made like it and then after he was done figur on it as
an articl of apparel he began to contempl it as an articl of diet
he put his foot on it and lift one of the sleev out with his teeth
and chew and chew at it gradual take it in and all the while
open and close his eye in a kind of religi ecstasi as if he had
never tast anyth as good as an overcoat befor in his life then
he smack his lip onc or twice and reach after the other sleev
next he tri the velvet collar and smile a smile of such content
that it was plain to see that he regard that as the daintiest thing
about an overcoat the tail went next along with some percuss cap
and cough candi and some figpast from constantinopl and then my
newspap correspond drop out and he took a chanc in that
manuscript letter written for the home paper but he was tread on
danger ground now he began to come across solid wisdom in those
document that was rather weighti on his stomach and occasion he
would take a joke that would shake him up till it loosen his teeth it
was get to be peril time with him but he held his grip with good
courag and hope till at last he began to stumbl on statement
that not even a camel could swallow with impun he began to gag and
gasp and his eye to stand out and his foreleg to spread and in about
a quarter of a minut he fell over as stiff as a carpent workbench
and die a death of indescrib agoni i went and pull the
manuscript out of his mouth and found that the sensit creatur had
choke to death on one of the mildest and gentlest statement of fact
that i ever laid befor a trust public

i was about to say when divert from my subject that occasion one
find sagebush five or six feet high and with a spread of branch and
foliag in proport but two or two and a half feet is the usual
height




chapter iv

as the sun went down and the even chill came on we made prepar
for bed we stir up the hard leather lettersack and the knotti
canva bag of print matter knotti and uneven becaus of project
end and corner of magazin box and book we stir them up and
redispos them in such a way as to make our bed as level as possibl
and we did improv it too though after all our work it had an upheav
and billowi look about it like a littl piec of a stormi sea next we
hunt up our boot from odd nook among the mailbag where they had
settl and put them on then we got down our coat vest pantaloon
and heavi woolen shirt from the armloop where they had been swing
all day and cloth ourselv in themfor there be no ladi either
at the station or in the coach and the weather be hot we had look
to our comfort by strip to our undercloth at nine oclock in the
morn all thing be now readi we stow the uneasi dictionari
where it would lie as quiet as possibl and place the watercanteen
and pistol where we could find them in the dark then we smoke a final
pipe and swap a final yarn after which we put the pipe tobacco
and bag of coin in snug hole and cave among the mailbag and then
fasten down the coach curtain all around and made the place as dark
as the insid of a cow  as the conductor phrase it in his picturesqu
way it was certain as dark as ani place could benoth was even
dim visibl in it and final we roll ourselv up like
silkworm each person in his own blanket and sank peac to sleep

whenev the stage stop to chang hors we would wake up and tri to
recollect where we wereand succeedand in a minut or two the stage
would be off again and we likewis we began to get into countri now
thread here and there with littl stream these had high steep bank
on each side and everi time we flew down one bank and scrambl up the
other our parti insid got mix somewhat first we would all be down
in a pile at the forward end of the stage near in a sit postur
and in a second we would shoot to the other end and stand on our head
and we would sprawl and kick too and ward off end and corner of
mailbag that came lumber over us and about us and as the dust rose
from the tumult we would all sneez in chorus and the major of us
would grumbl and probabl say some hasti thing like take your elbow
out of my rib cant you quit crowd 

everi time we avalanch from one end of the stage to the other the
unabridg dictionari would come too and everi time it came it damag
somebodi one trip it barked the secretari elbow the next trip it
hurt me in the stomach and the third it tilt bemi nose up till he
could look down his nostrilsh said the pistol and coin soon settl
to the bottom but the pipe pipestem tobacco and canteen clatter
and flounder after the dictionari everi time it made an assault on us
and aid and abet the book by spill tobacco in our eye and water
down our back

still all thing consid it was a veri comfort night it wore
gradual away and when at last a cold gray light was visibl through
the pucker and chink in the curtain we yawn and stretch with
satisfact shed our cocoon and felt that we had slept as much as was
necessari by and by as the sun rose up and warm the world we pull
off our cloth and got readi for breakfast we were just pleasant in
time for five minut afterward the driver sent the weird music of his
bugl wind over the grassi solitud and present we detect a low
hut or two in the distanc then the rattl of the coach the clatter
of our six hors hoof and the driver crisp command awok to a
louder and stronger emphasi and we went sweep down on the station at
our smartest speed it was fascinatingthat old overland stagecoach

we jump out in undress uniform the driver toss his gather rein
out on the ground gape and stretch complac drew off his heavi
buckskin glove with great deliber and insuffer dignitytak
not the slightest notic of a dozen solicit inquir after his health
and humbl faceti and flatter accost and obsequi tender of
servic from five or six hairi and halfcivil stationkeep and
hostler who were nimbl unhitch our steed and bring the fresh
team out of the stablesfor in the eye of the stagedriv of that day
stationkeep and hostler were a sort of good enough low creatur
use in their place and help to make up a world but not the kind
of be which a person of distinct could afford to concern himself
with while on the contrari in the eye of the stationkeep and the
hostler the stagedriv was a heroa great and shine dignitari the
world favorit son the envi of the peopl the observ of the
nation when they spoke to him they receiv his insol silenc
meek and as be the natur and proper conduct of so great a man
when he open his lip they all hung on his word with admir he
never honor a particular individu with a remark but address it
with a broad general to the hors the stabl the surround
countri and the human underl when he discharg a faceti
insult person at a hostler that hostler was happi for the day
when he utter his one jestold as the hill coars profan witless
and inflict on the same audienc in the same languag everi time his
coach drove up thereth varlet roar and slap their thigh and
swore it was the best thing theyd ever heard in all their live and
how they would fli around when he want a basin of water a gourd of the
same or a light for his pipe but they would instant insult a
passeng if he so far forgot himself as to crave a favor at their hand
they could do that sort of insol as well as the driver they copi it
fromfor let it be born in mind the overland driver had but littl
less contempt for his passeng than he had for his hostler

the hostler and stationkeep treat the realli power conductor of
the coach mere with the best of what was their idea of civil but
the driver was the onli be they bow down to and worship how
admir they would gaze up at him in his high seat as he glove
himself with linger deliber while some happi hostler held the
bunch of rein aloft and wait patient for him to take it and how
they would bombard him with glorifi ejacul as he crack his
long whip and went career away

the station build were long low hut made of sundri mudcolor
brick laid up without mortar adob the spaniard call these brick
and american shorten it to dobi the roof which had no slant to
them worth speak of were thatch and then sod or cover with a
thick layer of earth and from this sprung a pretti rank growth of weed
and grass it was the first time we had ever seen a man front yard on
top of his hous the build consist of barn stableroom for
twelv or fifteen hors and a hut for an eatingroom for passeng
this latter had bunk in it for the stationkeep and a hostler or two
you could rest your elbow on it eav and you had to bend in order to
get in at the door in place of a window there was a squar hole about
larg enough for a man to crawl through but this had no glass in it
there was no floor but the ground was pack hard there was no
stove but the fireplac serv all need purpos there were no
shelv no cupboard no closet in a corner stood an open sack of
flour and nestl against it base were a coupl of black and vener
tin coffeepot a tin teapot a littl bag of salt and a side of bacon


by the door of the stationkeep den outsid was a tin washbasin
on the ground near it was a pail of water and a piec of yellow bar
soap and from the eav hung a hoari blue woolen shirt signific
but this latter was the stationkeep privat towel and onli two
person in all the parti might ventur to use itth stagedriv and
the conductor the latter would not from a sens of decenc the former
would not becaus did not choos to encourag the advanc of a
stationkeep we had towelsin the valis they might as well have
been in sodom and gomorrah we and the conductor use our
handkerchief and the driver his pantaloon and sleev by the door
insid was fasten a small oldfashion lookingglass frame with two
littl fragment of the origin mirror lodg down in one corner of it
this arrang afford a pleasant doublebarrel portrait of you when
you look into it with one half of your head set up a coupl of inch
abov the other half from the glass frame hung the half of a comb by a
stringbut if i had to describ that patriarch or die i believ i would
order some sampl coffin

it had come down from esau and samson and had been accumul hair
ever sincealong with certain impur in one corner of the room
stood three or four rifl and musket togeth with horn and pouch
of ammunit the stationmen wore pantaloon of coars countrywoven
stuff and into the seat and the insid of the leg were sew ampl
addit of buckskin to do duti in place of leg when the man rode
horsebackso the pant were half dull blue and half yellow and
unspeak picturesqu the pant were stuf into the top of high
boot the heel whereof were arm with great spanish spur whose
littl iron clog and chain jingl with everi step the man wore a
huge beard and mustachio an old slouch hat a blue woolen shirt no
suspend no vest no coatin a leathern sheath in his belt a great
long navy revolv slung on right side hammer to the front and
project from his boot a hornhandl bowieknif the furnitur of
the hut was neither gorgeous nor much in the way the rockingchair and
sofa were not present and never had been but they were repres by
two threeleg stool a pineboard bench four feet long and two empti
candlebox the tabl was a greasi board on stilt and the
tablecloth and napkin had not comeand they were not look for them
either a batter tin platter a knife and fork and a tin pint cup
were at each man place and the driver had a queenswar saucer that
had seen better day of cours this duke sat at the head of the tabl
there was one isol piec of tabl furnitur that bore about it a
touch air of grandeur in misfortun this was the caster it was
german silver and crippl and rusti but it was so preposter out
of place there that it was suggest of a tatter exil king among
barbarian and the majesti of it nativ posit compel respect even
in it degrad

there was onli one cruet left and that was a stopperless flyspeck
brokenneck thing with two inch of vinegar in it and a dozen
preserv fli with their heel up and look sorri they had invest
there

the stationkeep upend a disk of last week bread of the shape and
size of an oldtim chees and carv some slab from it which were as
good as nicholson pavement and tender

he slice off a piec of bacon for each man but onli the experienc old
hand made out to eat it for it was condemn armi bacon which the
unit state would not feed to it soldier in the fort and the stage
compani had bought it cheap for the susten of their passeng and
employe we may have found this condemn armi bacon further out on
the plain than the section i am locat it in but we found itther
is no gainsay that

then he pour for us a beverag which he call slum gullion  and it
is hard to think he was not inspir when he name it it realli
pretend to be tea but there was too much dishrag and sand and old
baconrind in it to deceiv the intellig travel

he had no sugar and no milknot even a spoon to stir the ingredi
with

we could not eat the bread or the meat nor drink the slumgullion  and
when i look at that melancholi vinegarcruet i thought of the anecdot
a veri veri old one even at that day of the travel who sat down to
a tabl which had noth on it but a mackerel and a pot of mustard he
ask the landlord if this was all the landlord said

all whi thunder and lightn i should think there was mackerel
enough there for six 

but i dont like mackerel 

ohthen help yourself to the mustard 

in other day i had consid it a good a veri good anecdot but
there was a dismal plausibl about it here that took all the humor
out of it

our breakfast was befor us but our teeth were idl

i tast and smelt and said i would take coffe i believ the
stationboss stop dead still and glare at me speechless at last
when he came to he turn away and said as one who commune with
himself upon a matter too vast to grasp

coffe well if that dont go clean ahead of me im dd 

we could not eat and there was no convers among the hostler and
herdsmenw all sat at the same board at least there was no
convers further than a singl hurri request now and then from
one employe to anoth it was alway in the same form and alway
gruffli friend it western fresh and novelti startl me at
first and interest me but it present grew monoton and lost it
charm it was

pass the bread you son of a skunk  no i forgetskunk was not the
word it seem to me it was still stronger than that i know it was in
fact but it is gone from my memori appar howev it is no
matterprob it was too strong for print anyway it is the landmark
in my memori which tell me where i first encount the vigor new
vernacular of the occident plain and mountain

we gave up the breakfast and paid our dollar apiec and went back to our
mailbag bed in the coach and found comfort in our pipe right here we
suffer the first diminut of our princ state we left our six
fine hors and took six mule in their place but they were wild
mexican fellow and a man had to stand at the head of each of them and
hold him fast while the driver glove and got himself readi and when at
last he grasp the rein and gave the word the men sprung sudden away
from the mule head and the coach shot from the station as if it had
issu from a cannon how the frantic anim did scamper it was a
fierc and furious gallopand the gait never alter for a moment till
we reel off ten or twelv mile and swept up to the next collect of
littl stationhut and stabl

so we flew along all day at  p m the belt of timber that fring the
north platt and mark it wind through the vast level floor of the
plain came in sight at  p m we cross a branch of the river and
at  p m we cross the platt itself and land at fort kearney
fiftysix hour out from st joethre hundr mile

now that was stagecoach on the great overland ten or twelv year
ago when perhap not more than ten men in america all told expect to
live to see a railroad follow that rout to the pacif but the
railroad is there now and it pictur a thousand odd comparison and
contrast in my mind to read the follow sketch in the new york time
of a recent trip over almost the veri ground i have been describ i
can scarc comprehend the new state of thing

across the contin

at   p m sunday we roll out of the station at omaha and
start westward on our long jaunt a coupl of hour out dinner
was announcedan event to those of us who had yet to experi
what it is to eat in one of pullman hotel on wheel so step
into the car next forward of our sleep palac we found ourselv
in the diningcar it was a revel to us that first dinner on
sunday and though we continu to dine for four day and had as
mani breakfast and supper our whole parti never ceas to admir
the perfect of the arrang and the marvel result
achiev upon tabl cover with snowi linen and garnish with
servic of solid silver ethiop waiter flit about in spotless
white place as by magic a repast at which delmonico himself could
have had no occas to blush and inde in some respect it
would be hard for that distinguish chef to match our menu for in
addit to all that ordinarili make up a firstchop dinner had we
not our antelop steak the gormand who has not experienc this
bah what doe he know of the feast of fat thing our delici
mountainbrook trout and choic fruit and berri and sauc

air of the prairi

you may depend upon it we all did justic to the good thing and
as we wash them down with bumper of sparkl krug whilst we
sped along at the rate of thirti mile an hour agre it was the
fastest live we had ever experienc we beat that howev two
day afterward when we made twentyseven mile in twentyseven
minut while our champagn glass fill to the brim spill not
a drop after dinner we repair to our drawingroom car and as

chapter v

anoth night of altern tranquil and turmoil but morn came
by and by it was anoth glad awaken to fresh breez vast expans
of level greensward bright sunlight an impress solitud utter
without visibl human be or human habit and an atmospher of
such amaz magnifi properti that tree that seem close at hand
were more than three mile away we resum undress uniform climb
atop of the fli coach dangl our leg over the side shout
occasion at our frantic mule mere to see them lay their ear back
and scamper faster tie our hat on to keep our hair from blow away
and level an outlook over the worldwid carpet about us for thing new
and strang to gaze at even at this day it thrill me through and
through to think of the life the glad and the wild sens of freedom
that use to make the blood danc in my vein on those fine overland
morn

along about an hour after breakfast we saw the first prairiedog
villag the first antelop and the first wolf if i rememb right
this latter was the regular cayot pronounc kyot of the farther
desert and if it was he was not a pretti creatur or respect
either for i got well acquaint with his race afterward and can speak
with confid the cayot is a long slim sick and sorrylook
skeleton with a gray wolfskin stretch over it a toler bushi tail
that forev sag down with a despair express of forsaken and
miseri a furtiv and evil eye and a long sharp face with slight
lift lip and expos teeth he has a general slink express all
over the cayot is a live breath allegori of want he is alway
hungri

he is alway poor out of luck and friendless the meanest creatur
despis him and even the flea would desert him for a velociped he is
so spiritless and coward that even while his expos teeth are
pretend a threat the rest of his face is apolog for it and he
is so home so scrawni and ribbi and coarsehair and piti
when he see you he lift his lip and let a flash of his teeth out and
then turn a littl out of the cours he was pursu depress his head
a bit and strike a long softfoot trot through the sagebrush
glanc over his shoulder at you from time to time till he is about
out of easi pistol rang and then he stop and take a deliber survey
of you he will trot fifti yard and stop againanoth fifti and stop
again and final the gray of his glide bodi blend with the gray of
the sagebrush and he disappear all this is when you make no
demonstr against him but if you do he develop a liveli interest
in his journey and instant electrifi his heel and put such a deal
of real estat between himself and your weapon that by the time you have
rais the hammer you see that you need a mini rifl and by the time
you have got him in line you need a rifl cannon and by the time you
have drawn a bead on him you see well enough that noth but an
unusu longwind streak of lightn could reach him where he is
now but if you start a swiftfoot dog after him you will enjoy it
ever so muchespeci if it is a dog that has a good opinion of
himself and has been brought up to think he know someth about speed

the cayot will go swing gentl off on that deceit trot of his and
everi littl while he will smile a fraud smile over his shoulder that
will fill that dog entir full of encourag and world ambit
and make him lay his head still lower to the ground and stretch his neck
further to the front and pant more fierc and stick his tail out
straighter behind and move his furious leg with a yet wilder frenzi
and leav a broader and broader and higher and denser cloud of desert
sand smoke behind and mark his long wake across the level plain
and all this time the dog is onli a short twenti feet behind the cayot
and to save the soul of him he cannot understand whi it is that he cannot
get percept closer and he begin to get aggrav and it make him
madder and madder to see how gentl the cayot glide along and never
pant or sweat or ceas to smile and he grow still more and more
incens to see how shame he has been taken in by an entir
stranger and what an ignobl swindl that long calm softfoot trot
is and next he notic that he is get fag and that the cayot
actual has to slacken speed a littl to keep from run away from
himand then that towndog is mad in earnest and he begin to strain
and weep and swear and paw the sand higher than ever and reach for the
cayot with concentr and desper energi this spurt find him
six feet behind the glide enemi and two mile from his friend and
then in the instant that a wild new hope is light up his face the
cayot turn and smile bland upon him onc more and with a someth
about it which seem to say well i shall have to tear myself away from
you bubbusi is busi and it will not do for me to be fool
along this way all dayand forthwith there is a rush sound and the
sudden split of a long crack through the atmospher and behold that
dog is solitari and alon in the midst of a vast solitud

it make his head swim he stop and look all around climb the
nearest sandmound and gaze into the distanc shake his head
reflect and then without a word he turn and jog along back to
his train and take up a humbl posit under the hindmost wagon and
feel unspeak mean and look asham and hang his tail at
halfmast for a week and for as much as a year after that whenev
there is a great hue and cri after a cayot that dog will mere glanc
in that direct without emot and appar observ to himself
i believ i do not wish ani of the pie 

the cayot live chiefli in the most desol and forbid desert
along with the lizard the jackassrabbit and the raven and get an
uncertain and precari live and earn it he seem to subsist
almost wholli on the carcas of oxen mule and hors that have drop
out of emigr train and die and upon windfal of carrion and
occasion legaci of offal bequeath to him by white men who have been
opul enough to have someth better to butcher than condemn armi
bacon

he will eat anyth in the world that his first cousin the
desertfrequ tribe of indian will and they will eat anyth
they can bite it is a curious fact that these latter are the onli
creatur known to histori who will eat nitroglycerin and ask for more
if they surviv

the cayot of the desert beyond the rocki mountain has a peculiar
hard time of it owe to the fact that his relat the indian are
just as apt to be the first to detect a seduct scent on the desert
breez and follow the fragranc to the late ox it eman from as he
is himself and when this occur he has to content himself with sit
off at a littl distanc watch those peopl strip off and dig out
everyth edibl and walk off with it then he and the wait raven
explor the skeleton and polish the bone it is consid that the
cayot and the obscen bird and the indian of the desert testifi their
blood kinship with each other in that they live togeth in the wast
place of the earth on term of perfect confid and friendship while
hate all other creatur and yearn to assist at their funer he
doe not mind go a hundr mile to breakfast and a hundr and fifti
to dinner becaus he is sure to have three or four day between meal
and he can just as well be travel and look at the sceneri as lie
around do noth and ad to the burden of his parent

we soon learn to recogn the sharp vicious bark of the cayot as it
came across the murki plain at night to disturb our dream among the
mailsack and rememb his forlorn aspect and his hard fortun made
shift to wish him the bless novelti of a long day good luck and a
limitless larder the morrow

and in the glare of whose great even the dazzl stagedriv
dwindl to a penni dip there were about eight of these king all
told on the overland rout

next in rank and import to the divisionag came the conductor 
his beat was the same length as the agentstwo hundr and fifti mile
he sat with the driver and when necessari rode that fear distanc
night and day without other rest or sleep than what he could get perch
thus on top of the fli vehicl think of it he had absolut charg
of the mail express matter passeng and stage coach until he
deliv them to the next conductor and got his receipt for them

consequ he had to be a man of intellig decis and
consider execut abil he was usual a quiet pleasant man
who attend close to his duti and was a good deal of a gentleman
it was not absolut necessari that the divisionag should be a
gentleman and occasion he wasnt but he was alway a general in
administr abil and a bulldog in courag and determin
otherwis the chieftainship over the lawless underl of the overland
servic would never in ani instanc have been to him anyth but an
equival for a month of insol and distress and a bullet and a
coffin at the end of it there were about sixteen or eighteen conductor
on the overland for there was a daili stage each way and a conductor on
everi stage

next in real and offici rank and import after the conductor came
my delight the drivernext in real but not in appar importancefor
we have seen that in the eye of the common herd the driver was to the
conductor as an admir is to the captain of the flagship the driver
beat was pretti long and his sleepingtim at the station pretti short
sometim and so but for the grandeur of his posit his would have
been a sorri life as well as a hard and a wear one we took a new
driver everi day or everi night for they drove backward and forward over
the same piec of road all the time and therefor we never got as well
acquaint with them as we did with the conductor and besid they
would have been abov be familiar with such rubbish as passeng
anyhow as a general thing still we were alway eager to get a sight
of each and everi new driver as soon as the watch chang for each and
everi day we were either anxious to get rid of an unpleas one or
loath to part with a driver we had learn to like and had come to be
sociabl and friend with and so the first question we ask the
conductor whenev we got to where we were to exchang driver was
alway which is him  the grammar was faulti mayb but we could not
know then that it would go into a book some day as long as everyth
went smooth the overland driver was well enough situat but if a
fellow driver got sick sudden it made troubl for the coach must go
on and so the potent who was about to climb down and take a luxuri
rest after his long night sieg in the midst of wind and rain and
dark had to stay where he was and do the sick man work onc in
the rocki mountain when i found a driver sound asleep on the box and
the mule go at the usual breakneck pace the conductor said never
mind him there was no danger and he was do doubl dutyhad driven
seventyf mile on one coach and was now go back over it on this
without rest or sleep a hundr and fifti mile of hold back of six
vindict mule and keep them from climb the tree it sound
incred but i rememb the statement well enough

the stationkeep hostler etc were low rough charact as
alreadi describ and from western nebraska to nevada a consider
sprinkl of them might be fair set down as outlawsfugit from
justic crimin whose best secur was a section of countri which was
without law and without even the pretenc of it when the
divisionagent issu an order to one of these parti he did it with
the full understand that he might have to enforc it with a navi
sixshoot and so he alway went fixed to make thing go along
smooth

now and then a divisionag was realli oblig to shoot a hostler
through the head to teach him some simpl matter that he could have
taught him with a club if his circumst and surround had been
differ but they were snappi abl men those divisionag and
when they tri to teach a subordin anyth that subordin
general got it through his head 

a great portion of this vast machinerythes hundr of men and
coach and thousand of mule and horseswa in the hand of mr ben
holliday all the western half of the busi was in his hand this
remind me of an incid of palestin travel which is pertin here so
i will transfer it just in the languag in which i find it set down in my
holi land notebook

no doubt everybodi has heard of ben hollidaya man of prodigi
energi who use to send mail and passeng fli across the
contin in his overland stagecoach like a veri whirlwindtwo
thousand long mile in fifteen day and a half by the watch but
this fragment of histori is not about ben holliday but about a
young new york boy by the name of jack who travel with our small
parti of pilgrim in the holi land and who had travel to
california in mr holliday overland coach three year befor
and had by no mean forgotten it or lost his gush admir of
mr h age nineteen jack was a good boya goodheart and
alway wellmean boy who had been rear in the citi of new
york and although he was bright and knew a great mani use
thing his scriptur educ had been a good deal neglectedto
such a degre inde that all holi land histori was fresh and new
to him and all bibl name mysteri that had never disturb his
virgin ear

also in our parti was an elder pilgrim who was the revers of
jack in that he was learn in the scriptur and an enthusiast
concern them he was our encyclopedia and we were never tire
of listen to his speech nor he of make them he never
pass a celebr local from bashan to bethlehem without
illumin it with an orat one day when camp near the
ruin of jericho he burst forth with someth like this

jack do you see that rang of mountain over yonder that bound
the jordan valley the mountain of moab jack think of it my
boyth actual mountain of moabrenown in scriptur histori
we are actual stand face to face with those illustri crag
and peaksand for all we know drop his voic impressively
our eye may be rest at this veri moment upon the spot where
lie the mysteri grave of mose think of it jack 

mose who  fall inflect

mose who jack you ought to be asham of yourselfyou ought to
be asham of such crimin ignor whi mose the great guid
soldier poet lawgiv of ancient israel jack from this spot
where we stand to egypt stretch a fear desert three hundr
mile in extentand across that desert that wonder man brought
the children of israel guid them with unfail sagac for
forti year over the sandi desol and among the obstruct
rock and hill and land them at last safe and sound within
sight of this veri spot and where we now stand they enter the
promis land with anthem of rejoic it was a wonder
wonder thing to do jack think of it 

forti year onli three hundr mile humph ben holliday would
have fetch them through in thirtysix hour 

the boy meant no harm he did not know that he had said anyth that
was wrong or irrever and so no one scold him or felt offend with
himand nobodi could but some ungener spirit incap of excus
the heedless blunder of a boy

at noon on the fifth day out we arriv at the cross of the south
platt  alia julesburg  alia overland citi  four hundr and
seventi mile from st josephth strangest quaintest funniest
frontier town that our untravel eye had ever stare at and been
astonish with




chapter vii

it did seem strang enough to see a town again after what appear to us
such a long acquaint with deep still almost lifeless and houseless
solitud we tumbl out into the busi street feel like meteor
peopl crumbl off the corner of some other world and waken up
sudden in this for an hour we took as much interest in overland citi
as if we had never seen a town befor the reason we had an hour to
spare was becaus we had to chang our stage for a less sumptuous
affair call a mudwagon and transfer our freight of mail

present we got under way again we came to the shallow yellow muddi
south platt with it low bank and it scatter flat sandbar and
pigmi islandsa melancholi stream straggl through the centr of the
enorm flat plain and onli save from be imposs to find with
the nake eye by it sentinel rank of scatter tree stand on either
bank the platt was up  they saidwhich made me wish i could see it
when it was down if it could look ani sicker and sorrier they said it
was a danger stream to cross now becaus it quicksand were liabl
to swallow up hors coach and passeng if an attempt was made to ford
it but the mail had to go and we made the attempt onc or twice in
midstream the wheel sunk into the yield sand so threaten that
we half believ we had dread and avoid the sea all our live to be
shipwreck in a mudwagon in the middl of a desert at last but we
drag through and sped away toward the set sun

next morn just befor dawn when about five hundr and fifti mile
from st joseph our mudwagon broke down we were to be delay five or
six hour and therefor we took hors by invit and join a
parti who were just start on a buffalo hunt it was nobl sport
gallop over the plain in the dewi fresh of the morn but our
part of the hunt end in disast and disgrac for a wound buffalo
bull chase the passeng bemi near two mile and then he forsook his
hors and took to a lone tree he was veri sullen about the matter for
some twentyfour hour but at last he began to soften littl by littl
and final he said

well it was not funni and there was no sens in those gawk make
themselv so faceti over it i tell you i was angri in earnest for
awhil i should have shot that long gang lubber they call hank if
i could have done it without crippl six or seven other peoplebut of
cours i couldnt the old allen so confound comprehens i wish
those loafer had been up in the tree they wouldnt have want to laugh
so if i had had a hors worth a centbut no the minut he saw that
buffalo bull wheel on him and give a bellow he rais straight up in the
air and stood on his heel the saddl began to slip and i took him
round the neck and laid close to him and began to pray then he came
down and stood up on the other end awhil and the bull actual stop
paw sand and bellow to contempl the inhuman spectacl

then the bull made a pass at him and utter a bellow that sound
perfect fright it was so close to me and that seem to liter
prostrat my hors reason and make a rave distract maniac of him
and i wish i may die if he didnt stand on his head for a quarter of a
minut and shed tear he was absolut out of his mindh was as
sure as truth itself and he realli didnt know what he was do then
the bull came charg at us and my hors drop down on all four and
took a fresh startand then for the next ten minut he would actual
throw one handspr after anoth so fast that the bull began to get
unsettl too and didnt know where to start inand so he stood there
sneez and shovel dust over his back and bellow everi now and
then and think he had got a fifteenhundr dollar circus hors for
breakfast certain well i was first out on his neckth hors not
the bullsand then underneath and next on his rump and sometim head
up and sometim heelsbut i tell you it seem solemn and aw to be
rip and tear and carri on so in the presenc of death as you
might say pretti soon the bull made a snatch for us and brought away
some of my hors tail i suppos but do not know be pretti busi at
the time but someth made him hungri for solitud and suggest to
him to get up and hunt for it

and then you ought to have seen that spider leg old skeleton go and
you ought to have seen the bull cut out after him toohead down tongu
out tail up bellow like everyth and actual mow down the
weed and tear up the earth and boost up the sand like a
whirlwind by georg it was a hot race i and the saddl were back on
the rump and i had the bridl in my teeth and hold on to the pommel
with both hand first we left the dog behind then we pass a jackass
rabbit then we overtook a cayot and were gain on an antelop when
the rotten girth let go and threw me about thirti yard off to the left
and as the saddl went down over the hors rump he gave it a lift with
his heel that sent it more than four hundr yard up in the air i wish
i may die in a minut if he didnt i fell at the foot of the onli
solitari tree there was in nine counti adjac as ani creatur could
see with the nake eye and the next second i had hold of the bark with
four set of nail and my teeth and the next second after that i was
astraddl of the main limb and blasphem my luck in a way that made my
breath smell of brimston i had the bull now if he did not think of
one thing but that one thing i dread i dread it veri serious
there was a possibl that the bull might not think of it but there
were greater chanc that he would i made up my mind what i would do in
case he did it was a littl over forti feet to the ground from where i
sat i cautious unwound the lariat from the pommel of my saddle

your saddl did you take your saddl up in the tree with you 

take it up in the tree with me whi how you talk of cours i didnt
no man could do that it fell in the tree when it came down 

ohexact 

certain i unwound the lariat and fasten one end of it to the
limb it was the veri best green rawhid and capabl of sustain
ton i made a slipnoos in the other end and then hung it down to see
the length it reach down twentytwo feethalf way to the ground
i then load everi barrel of the allen with a doubl charg i felt
satisfi i said to myself if he never think of that one thing that i
dread all rightbut if he doe all right anyhowi am fix for him
but dont you know that the veri thing a man dread is the thing that
alway happen inde it is so i watch the bull now with anxieti
anxieti which no one can conceiv of who has not been in such a
situat and felt that at ani moment death might come present a
thought came into the bull eye i knew it said iif my nerv fail
now i am lost sure enough it was just as i had dread he start in
to climb the tree

what the bull 

of coursewho els 

but a bull cant climb a tree 

he cant cant he sinc you know so much about it did you ever see a
bull tri 

no i never dreamt of such a thing 

well then what is the use of your talk that way then becaus you
never saw a thing done is that ani reason whi it cant be done 

well all rightgo on what did you do 

the bull start up and got along well for about ten feet then slip
and slid back i breath easier he tri it againgot up a littl
higherslip again but he came at it onc more and this time he was
care he got gradual higher and higher and my spirit went down
more and more up he camean inch at a timewith his eye hot and his
tongu hang out higher and higherhitch his foot over the stump
of a limb and look up as much as to say you are my meat friend 
up againhigh and higher and get more excit the closer he got
he was within ten feet of me i took a long breath and then said i
it is now or never  i had the coil of the lariat all readi i paid it
out slowli till it hung right over his head all of a sudden i let go of
the slack and the slipnoos fell fair round his neck quicker than
lightn i out with the allen and let him have it in the face it was
an aw roar and must have scare the bull out of his sens when the
smoke clear away there he was dangl in the air twenti foot from
the ground and go out of one convuls into anoth faster than you
could count i didnt stop to count anyhowi shin down the tree and
shot for home 

bemi is all that true just as you have state it 

i wish i may rot in my track and die the death of a dog if it isnt 

well we cant refus to believ it and we dont but if there were
some proofs

proof did i bring back my lariat 

no 

did i bring back my hors 

no 

did you ever see the bull again 

no 

well then what more do you want i never saw anybodi as particular as
you are about a littl thing like that 

i made up my mind that if this man was not a liar he onli miss it by
the skin of his teeth this episod remind me of an incid of my
brief sojourn in siam year afterward the european citizen of a town
in the neighborhood of bangkok had a prodigi among them by the name of
eckert an englishmana person famous for the number ingenu and
impos magnitud of his lie they were alway repeat his most
celebr falsehood and alway tri to draw him out befor
stranger but they seldom succeed twice he was invit to the hous
where i was visit but noth could seduc him into a specimen lie
one day a planter name bascom an influenti man and a proud and
sometim irasc one invit me to ride over with him and call on
eckert as we jog along said he

now do you know where the fault lie it lie in put eckert on his
guard the minut the boy go to pump at eckert he know perfect
well what they are after and of cours he shut up his shell anybodi
might know he would but when we get there we must play him finer than
that let him shape the convers to suit himselflet him drop it or
chang it whenev he want to let him see that nobodi is tri to
draw him out just let him have his own way he will soon forget
himself and begin to grind out lie like a mill dont get impati
just keep quiet and let me play him i will make him lie it doe seem
to me that the boy must be blind to overlook such an obvious and simpl
trick as that 

eckert receiv us heartilya pleasantspoken gentlemann creatur
we sat in the veranda an hour sip english ale and talk about the
king and the sacr white eleph the sleep idol and all manner of
thing and i notic that my comrad never led the convers himself
or shape it but simpli follow eckert lead and betray no
solicitud and no anxieti about anyth the effect was short
percept eckert began to grow communic he grew more and more
at his eas and more and more talkat and sociabl anoth hour
pass in the same way and then all of a sudden eckert said

notwithstand the hors was behav well enough when i branch off
homeward bascom said

chapter viii

in a littl while all interest was taken up in stretch our neck and
watch for the ponyriderth fleet messeng who sped across the
contin from st joe to sacramento carri letter nineteen hundr
mile in eight day think of that for perish hors and human flesh
and blood to do the ponyrid was usual a littl bit of a man
brim of spirit and endur no matter what time of the day or night
his watch came on and no matter whether it was winter or summer
rain snow hail or sleet or whether his beat was a level
straight road or a crazi trail over mountain crag and precipic or
whether it led through peac region or region that swarm with
hostil indian he must be alway readi to leap into the saddl and be
off like the wind there was no idlingtim for a ponyrid on duti
he rode fifti mile without stop by daylight moonlight starlight
or through the black of darknessjust as it happen he rode a
splendid hors that was born for a racer and fed and lodg like a
gentleman kept him at his utmost speed for ten mile and then as he
came crash up to the station where stood two men hold fast a fresh
impati steed the transfer of rider and mailbag was made in the
twinkl of an eye and away flew the eager pair and were out of sight
befor the spectat could get hard the ghost of a look both rider
and hors went fli light  the rider dress was thin and fit
close he wore a roundabout  and a skullcap and tuck his
pantaloon into his boottop like a racerid he carri no armsh
carri noth that was not absolut necessari for even the postag
on his literari freight was worth five dollar a letter

he got but littl frivol correspond to carryhi bag had busi
letter in it most his hors was strip of all unnecessari weight
too he wore a littl wafer of a racingsaddl and no visibl blanket
he wore light shoe or none at all the littl flat mailpocket
strap under the rider thigh would each hold about the bulk of a
child primer they held mani and mani an import busi chapter
and newspap letter but these were written on paper as airi and thin as
goldleaf near and thus bulk and weight were econom the
stagecoach travel about a hundr to a hundr and twentyf mile
a day twentyfour hour the ponyrid about two hundr and fifti
there were about eighti ponyrid in the saddl all the time night and
day stretch in a long scatter process from missouri to
california forti fli eastward and forti toward the west and among
them make four hundr gallant hors earn a stir livelihood and
see a deal of sceneri everi singl day in the year

we had had a consum desir from the begin to see a ponyrid
but somehow or other all that pass us and all that met us manag to
streak by in the night and so we heard onli a whiz and a hail and the
swift phantom of the desert was gone befor we could get our head out of
the window but now we were expect one along everi moment and would
see him in broad daylight present the driver exclaim

here he come 

everi neck is stretch further and everi eye strain wider away
across the endless dead level of the prairi a black speck appear
against the sky and it is plain that it move well i should think so

in a second or two it becom a hors and rider rise and fall
rise and fallingsweep toward us nearer and nearergrow more
and more distinct more and more sharpli definednear and still
nearer and the flutter of the hoof come faint to the earanoth
instant a whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck a wave of the rider
hand but no repli and man and hors burst past our excit face and
go wing away like a belat fragment of a storm

so sudden is it all and so like a flash of unreal fanci that but for
the flake of white foam left quiver and perish on a mailsack after
the vision had flash by and disappear we might have doubt whether
we had seen ani actual hors and man at all mayb

we rattl through scott bluff pass by and by it was along here
somewher that we first came across genuin and unmistak alkali water
in the road and we cordial hail it as a firstclass curios and a
thing to be mention with eclat in letter to the ignor at home
this water gave the road a soapi appear and in mani place the
ground look as if it had been whitewash i think the strang alkali
water excit us as much as ani wonder we had come upon yet and i know
we felt veri complac and conceit and better satisfi with life
after we had ad it to our list of thing which we had seen and some
other peopl had not in a small way we were the same sort of simpleton
as those who climb unnecessarili the peril peak of mont blanc and the
matterhorn and deriv no pleasur from it except the reflect that it
isnt a common experi but onc in a while one of those parti
trip and come dart down the long mountaincrag in a sit
postur make the crust snow smoke behind him flit from bench to
bench and from terrac to terrac jar the earth where he strike
and still glanc and flit on again stick an iceberg into
himself everi now and then and tear his cloth snatch at thing
to save himself take hold of tree and fetch them along with him
root and all start littl rock now and then then big boulder
then acr of ice and snow and patch of forest gather and still
gather as he goe ad and still ad to his mass and sweep
grandeur as he near a three thousandfoot precipic till at last he
wave his hat magnific and ride into etern on the back of a
rage and toss avalanch

this is all veri fine but let us not be carri away by excit but
ask calm how doe this person feel about it in his cooler moment next
day with six or seven thousand feet of snow and stuff on top of him

we cross the sand hill near the scene of the indian mail robberi and
massacr of  wherein the driver and conductor perish and also all
the passeng but one it was suppos but this must have been a
mistak for at differ time afterward on the pacif coast i was
person acquaint with a hundr and thirtythre or four peopl who
were wound dure that massacr and bare escap with their live
there was no doubt of the truth of iti had it from their own lip one
of these parti told me that he kept come across arrowhead in his
system for near seven year after the massacr and anoth of them
told me that he was struck so liter full of arrow that after the
indian were gone and he could rais up and examin himself he could not
restrain his tear for his cloth were complet ruin

the most trustworthi tradit aver howev that onli one man a
person name babbitt surviv the massacr and he was desper
wound he drag himself on his hand and knee for one leg was
broken to a station sever mile away he did it dure portion of
two night lie conceal one day and part of anoth and for more
than forti hour suffer unimagin anguish from hunger thirst and
bodili pain the indian rob the coach of everyth it contain
includ quit an amount of treasur




chapter ix

we pass fort larami in the night and on the seventh morn out we
found ourselv in the black hill with larami peak at our elbow
appar loom vast and solitarya deep dark rich indigo blue in
hue so portent did the old colossus frown under his beetl brow
of stormcloud he was thirti or forti mile away in realiti but he
onli seem remov a littl beyond the low ridg at our right we
breakfast at horsesho station six hundr and seventysix mile out
from st joseph we had now reach a hostil indian countri and dure
the afternoon we pass laparell station and enjoy great discomfort
all the time we were in the neighborhood be awar that mani of the
tree we dash by at arm length conceal a lurk indian or two
dure the preced night an ambush savag had sent a bullet through
the ponyrid jacket but he had ridden on just the same becaus
ponyrid were not allow to stop and inquir into such thing except
when kill as long as they had life enough left in them they had to
stick to the hors and ride even if the indian had been wait for
them a week and were entir out of patienc about two hour and a
half befor we arriv at laparell station the keeper in charg of it
had fire four time at an indian but he said with an injur air that
the indian had skip around so to spile everythingand ammunit
blame skurs too  the most natur infer convey by his manner of
speak was that in skip around  the indian had taken an unfair
advantag

the coach we were in had a neat hole through it fronta reminisc of
it last trip through this region the bullet that made it wound the
driver slight but he did not mind it much he said the place to keep
a man huffy was down on the southern overland among the apach
befor the compani move the stage line up on the northern rout he
said the apach use to annoy him all the time down there and that he
came as near as anyth to starv to death in the midst of abund
becaus they kept him so leaki with bullet hole that he couldnt hold
his vittl 

this person statement were not general believ

we shut the blind down veri tight that first night in the hostil
indian countri and lay on our arm we slept on them some but most of
the time we onli lay on them we did not talk much but kept quiet and
listen it was an inkyblack night and occasion raini we were
among wood and rock hill and gorgesso shut in in fact that when
we peep through a chink in a curtain we could discern noth the
driver and conductor on top were still too or onli spoke at long
interv in low tone as is the way of men in the midst of invis
danger we listen to raindrop patter on the roof and the
grind of the wheel through the muddi gravel and the low wail of
the wind and all the time we had that absurd sens upon us insepar
from travel at night in a closecurtain vehicl the sens of remain
perfect still in one place notwithstand the jolt and sway of
the vehicl the trampl of the hors and the grind of the wheel
we listen a long time with intent faculti and bate breath everi
time one of us would relax and draw a long sigh of relief and start to
say someth a comrad would be sure to utter a sudden hark  and
instant the experiment was rigid and listen again so the
tiresom minut and decad of minut drag away until at last our
tens form film over with a dull conscious and we slept if one
might call such a condit by so strong a namefor it was a sleep set
with a hairtrigg it was a sleep seeth and teem with a weird
and distress confus of shred and fagend of dreamsa sleep that
was a chao present dream and sleep and the sullen hush of the
night were startl by a ring report and cloven by such a long wild
agon shriek then we heardten step from the stage

help help help  it was our driver voic 

kill him kill him like a dog 

im be murder will no man lend me a pistol 

look out head him off head him off 

two pistol shot a confus of voic and the trampl of mani feet
as if a crowd were close and surg togeth around some object
sever heavi dull blow as with a club a voic that said appeal
dont gentlemen pleas dontim a dead man  then a fainter groan
and anoth blow and away sped the stage into the dark and left the
grisli mysteri behind us 

what a startl it was eight second would ampli cover the time it
occupiedmayb even five would do it we onli had time to plung at a
curtain and unbuckl and unbutton part of it in an awkward and hinder
flurri when our whip crack sharpli overhead and we went rumbl and
thunder away down a mountain grade 

we fed on that mysteri the rest of the nightwhat was left of it for it
was wane fast it had to remain a present mysteri for all we could
get from the conductor in answer to our hail was someth that sound
through the clatter of the wheel like tell you in the morn 

so we lit our pipe and open the corner of a curtain for a chimney and
lay there in the dark listen to each other stori of how he first
felt and how mani thousand indian he first thought had hurl themselv
upon us and what his remembr of the subsequ sound was and the
order of their occurr and we theoriz too but there was never a
theori that would account for our driver voic be out there nor yet
account for his indian murder talk such good english if they were
indian

so we chat and smoke the rest of the night comfort away our
bode anxieti be somehow marvel dissip by the real presenc
of someth to be anxious about

we never did get much satisfact about that dark occurr all that
we could make out of the odd and end of the inform we gather in
the morn was that the disturb occur at a station that we
chang driver there and that the driver that got off there had been
talk rough about some of the outlaw that infest the region for
there wasnt a man around there but had a price on his head and didnt
dare show himself in the settlement  the conductor said he had talk
rough about these charact and ought to have drove up there with
his pistol cock and readi on the seat alongsid of him and begun
busi himself becaus ani softi would know they would be lay for
him 

that was all we could gather and we could see that neither the conductor
nor the new driver were much concern about the matter they plain
had littl respect for a man who would deliv offens opinion of
peopl and then be so simpl as to come into their presenc unprepar to
back his judgment  as they pleasant phrase the kill of ani
fellowb who did not like said opinion and likewis they plain
had a contempt for the man poor discret in ventur to rous the
wrath of such utter reckless wild beast as those outlawsand the
conductor ad

i tell you it as much as slade himself want to do 

this remark creat an entir revolut in my curios i care
noth now about the indian and even lost interest in the murder
driver there was such magic in that name slade day or night now i
stood alway readi to drop ani subject in hand to listen to someth
new about slade and his ghast exploit even befor we got to overland
citi we had begun to hear about slade and his division for he was a
divisionagent on the overland and from the hour we had left overland
citi we had heard driver and conductor talk about onli three thing
californi  the nevada silver mine and this desperado slade and a
deal the most of the talk was about slade we had gradual come to have
a realiz sens of the fact that slade was a man whose heart and hand
and soul were steep in the blood of offend against his digniti a
man who aw aveng all injuri affront insult or slight of
whatev kindon the spot if he could year afterward if lack of
earlier opportun compel it a man whose hate tortur him day and
night till vengeanc appeas itand not an ordinari vengeanc either
but his enemi absolut deathnoth less a man whose face would
light up with a terribl joy when he surpris a foe and had him at a
disadvantag a high and effici servant of the overland an outlaw
among outlaw and yet their relentless scourg slade was at onc the
most bloodi the most danger and the most valuabl citizen that
inhabit the savag fast of the mountain




chapter x

realli and truli two third of the talk of driver and conductor had
been about this man slade ever sinc the day befor we reach
julesburg in order that the eastern reader may have a clear concept
of what a rocki mountain desperado is in his highest state of
develop i will reduc all this mass of overland gossip to one
straightforward narrat and present it in the follow shape

slade was born in illinoi of good parentag at about twentysix year
of age he kill a man in a quarrel and fled the countri at st joseph
missouri he join one of the earli californiabound emigr train
and was given the post of trainmast one day on the plain he had an
angri disput with one of his wagondriv and both drew their
revolv but the driver was the quicker artist and had his weapon
cock first so slade said it was a piti to wast life on so small a
matter and propos that the pistol be thrown on the ground and the
quarrel settl by a fistfight the unsuspect driver agre and
threw down his pistolwhereupon slade laugh at his simplic and
shot him dead

he made his escap and live a wild life for awhil divid his time
between fight indian and avoid an illinoi sheriff who had been
sent to arrest him for his first murder it is said that in one indian
battl he kill three savag with his own hand and afterward cut their
ear off and sent them with his compliment to the chief of the tribe

slade soon gain a name for fearless resolut and this was suffici
merit to procur for him the import post of overland divisionag at
julesburg in place of mr jule remov for some time previous the
compani hors had been frequent stolen and the coach delay by
gang of outlaw who were wont to laugh at the idea of ani man have
the temer to resent such outrag slade resent them prompt

the outlaw soon found that the new agent was a man who did not fear
anyth that breath the breath of life he made short work of all
offend the result was that delay ceas the compani properti was
let alon and no matter what happen or who suffer slade coach
went through everi time true in order to bring about this wholesom
chang slade had to kill sever mensom say three other say four
and other sixbut the world was the richer for their loss the first
promin difficulti he had was with the exag jule who bore the
reput of be a reckless and desper man himself jule hate
slade for supplant him and a good fair occas for a fight was all
he was wait for by and by slade dare to employ a man whom jule had
onc discharg next slade seiz a team of stagehors which he
accus jule of have driven off and hidden somewher for his own use
war was declar and for a day or two the two men walk warili about
the street seek each other jule arm with a doublebarrel shot
gun and slade with his historycr revolv final as slade
step into a store jule pour the content of his gun into him from
behind the door slade was plucki and jule got sever bad pistol
wound in return

then both men fell and were carri to their respect lodg both
swear that better aim should do deadlier work next time both were
bedridden a long time but jule got to his feet first and gather his
possess togeth pack them on a coupl of mule and fled to the
rocki mountain to gather strength in safeti against the day of
reckon for mani month he was not seen or heard of and was
gradual drop out of the remembr of all save slade himself but
slade was not the man to forget him on the contrari common report said
that slade kept a reward stand for his captur dead or aliv

after awhil see that slade energet administr had restor
peac and order to one of the worst divis of the road the overland
stage compani transfer him to the rocki ridg divis in the rocki
mountain to see if he could perform a like miracl there it was the
veri paradis of outlaw and desperado there was absolut no
semblanc of law there violenc was the rule forc was the onli
recogn author the commonest misunderstand were settl on
the spot with the revolv or the knife murder were done in open day
and with sparkl frequenc and nobodi thought of inquir into them
it was consid that the parti who did the kill had their privat
reason for it for other peopl to meddl would have been look upon as
indel after a murder all that rocki mountain etiquett requir
of a spectat was that he should help the gentleman buri his game
otherwis his churlish would sure be rememb against him the
first time he kill a man himself and need a neighbor turn in
inter him

slade took up his resid sweet and peac in the midst of this
hive of horsethiev and assassin and the veri first time one of them
air his insol swagger in his presenc he shot him dead he
began a raid on the outlaw and in a singular short space of time he
had complet stop their depred on the stage stock recov a
larg number of stolen hors kill sever of the worst desperado of
the district and gain such a dread ascend over the rest that they
respect him admir him fear him obey him he wrought the same
marvel chang in the way of the communiti that had mark his
administr at overland citi he captur two men who had stolen
overland stock and with his own hand he hang them he was suprem
judg in his district and he was juri and execution likewiseand not
onli in the case of offenc against his employ but against pass
emigr as well on one occas some emigr had their stock lost
or stolen and told slade who chanc to visit their camp with a
singl companion he rode to a ranch the owner of which he suspect
and open the door commenc fire kill three and wound the
fourth

from a bloodthirstili interest littl montana book the vigilant
of montana  by prof thos j dimsdal i take this paragraph

while on the road slade held absolut sway he would ride down to
a station get into a quarrel turn the hous out of window and
maltreat the occup most cruelli the unfortun had no mean
of redress and were compel to recuper as best they could 

on one of these occas it is said he kill the father of the fine
littl halfbre boy jemmi whom he adopt and who live with his
widow after his execut stori of slade hang men and of
innumer assault shoot stab and beat in which he was
a princip actor form part of the legend of the stage line as for
minor quarrel and shoot it is absolut certain that a minut
histori of slade life would be one long record of such practic

slade was a matchless marksman with a navi revolv the legend say
that one morn at rocki ridg when he was feel comfort he saw
a man approach who had offend him some day beforeobserv the fine
memori he had for matter like thatand gentlemen  said slade
draw it is a good twentyyard shotil clip the third button on
his coat  which he did the bystand all admir it and they all
attend the funer too

on one occas a man who kept a littl whiskyshelf at the station did
someth which anger sladeand went and made his will a day or two
afterward slade came in and call for some brandi the man reach
under the counter ostens to get a bottleposs to get someth
els but slade smile upon him that peculiar bland and satisfi
smile of his which the neighbor had long ago learn to recogn as a
deathwarr in disguis and told him to none of that pass out the
highpric articl  so the poor barkeep had to turn his back and
get the highpric brandi from the shelf and when he face around again
he was look into the muzzl of slade pistol and the next
instant  ad my inform impress he was one of the deadest
men that ever live 

the stagedriv and conductor told us that sometim slade would leav
a hate enemi wholli unmolest unnot and unment for week
togetherhad done it onc or twice at ani rate and some said they
believ he did it in order to lull the victim into unwatch so
that he could get the advantag of them and other said they believ he
save up an enemi that way just as a schoolboy save up a cake and made
the pleasur go as far as it would by gloat over the anticip
one of these case was that of a frenchman who had offend slade
to the surpris of everybodi slade did not kill him on the spot but let
him alon for a consider time final howev he went to the
frenchman hous veri late one night knock and when his enemi open
the door shot him deadpush the corps insid the door with his foot
set the hous on fire and burn up the dead man his widow and three
children i heard this stori from sever differ peopl and they
evid believ what they were say it may be true and it may
not give a dog a bad name  etc

slade was captur onc by a parti of men who intend to lynch him
they disarm him and shut him up in a strong loghous and place a
guard over him he prevail on his captor to send for his wife so
that he might have a last interview with her she was a brave love
spirit woman she jump on a hors and rode for life and death
when she arriv they let her in without search her and befor the
door could be close she whip out a coupl of revolv and she and
her lord march forth defi the parti and then under a brisk fire
they mount doubl and gallop away unharm

in the ful of time slade myrmidon captur his ancient enemi
jule whom they found in a wellchosen hidingplac in the remot
fast of the mountain gain a precari livelihood with his
rifl they brought him to rocki ridg bound hand and foot and
deposit him in the middl of the cattleyard with his back against a
post it is said that the pleasur that lit slade face when he heard
of it was someth fear to contempl he examin his enemi to see
that he was secur tie and then went to bed content to wait till
morn befor enjoy the luxuri of kill him jule spent the night
in the cattleyard and it is a region where warm night are never known
in the morn slade practis on him with his revolv nip the
flesh here and there and occasion clip off a finger while jule
beg him to kill him outright and put him out of his miseri final
slade reload and walk up close to his victim made some
characterist remark and then dispatch him the bodi lay there half
a day nobodi ventur to touch it without order and then slade
detail a parti and assist at the burial himself but he first cut
off the dead man ear and put them in his vest pocket where he carri
them for some time with great satisfact that is the stori as i have
frequent heard it told and seen it in print in california newspap
it is doubtless correct in all essenti particular

in due time we rattl up to a stagest and sat down to
breakfast with a halfsavag halfcivil compani of arm and
beard mountain ranchmen and station employe the most
gentlemanlyappear quiet and affabl offic we had yet found along
the road in the overland compani servic was the person who sat at the
head of the tabl at my elbow never youth stare and shiver as i did
when i heard them call him slade

here was romanc and i sit face to face with it look upon it
touch ithobnob with it as it were here right by my side was
the actual ogr who in fight and brawl and various way had taken the
live of twentysix human be or all men lie about him i suppos i
was the proudest stripl that ever travel to see strang land and
wonder peopl

he was so friend and so gentlespoken that i warm to him in
spite of his aw histori it was hard possibl to realiz that
this pleasant person was the pitiless scourg of the outlaw the
rawheadandbloodybon the nurs mother of the mountain terrifi
their children with and to this day i can rememb noth remark
about slade except that his face was rather broad across the cheek bone
and that the cheek bone were low and the lip peculiar thin and
straight but that was enough to leav someth of an effect upon me
for sinc then i seldom see a face possess those characterist
without fanci that the owner of it is a danger man

the coffe ran out at least it was reduc to one tincup and slade
was about to take it when he saw that my cup was empti

he polit offer to fill it but although i want it i polit
declin i was afraid he had not kill anybodi that morn and might
be need divers but still with firm polit he insist on
fill my cup and said i had travel all night and better deserv it
than heand while he talk he placid pour the fluid to the last
drop i thank him and drank it but it gave me no comfort for i could
not feel sure that he would not be sorri present that he had given it
away and proceed to kill me to distract his thought from the loss
but noth of the kind occur we left him with onli twentysix dead
peopl to account for and i felt a tranquil satisfact in the thought
that in so judici take care of no  at that breakfastt i had
pleasant escap be no  slade came out to the coach and saw us
off first order certain rearrang of the mailbag for our
comfort and then we took leav of him satisfi that we should hear of
him again some day and wonder in what connect




chapter xi

and sure enough two or three year afterward we did hear him again
news came to the pacif coast that the vigil committe in montana
whither slade had remov from rocki ridg had hang him i find an
account of the affair in the thrill littl book i quot a paragraph
from in the last chapterth vigilant of montana be a reliabl
account of the captur trial and execut of henri plummer notori
road agent band by prof thos j dimsdal virginia citi m t 
mr dimsdal chapter is well worth read as a specimen of how the
peopl of the frontier deal with crimin when the court of law prove
ineffici mr dimsdal make two remark about slade both of which
are accur descript and one of which is exceed picturesqu
those who saw him in his natur state onli would pronounc him to be a
kind husband a most hospit host and a courteous gentleman on the
contrari those who met him when madden with liquor and surround by a
gang of arm rough would pronounc him a fiend incarn  and this
from fort kearney west he was fear a great deal more than the
almighti  for compact simplic and vigor of express i will
back that sentenc against anyth in literatur mr dimsdal
narrat is as follow in all place where ital occur they are
mine

after the execut of the five men on the th of januari the
vigilant consid that their work was near end they had
freed the countri of highwaymen and murder to a great extent and
they determin that in the absenc of the regular civil author
they would establish a peopl court where all offend should be
tri by judg and juri this was the nearest approach to social
order that the circumst permit and though strict legal
author was want yet the peopl were firm determin to
maintain it effici and to enforc it decre it may here be
mention that the overt act which was the last round on the fatal
ladder lead to the scaffold on which slade perish was the
tear in piec and stamp upon a writ of this court follow
by his arrest of the judg alex davi by author of a present
derring and with his own hand

j a slade was himself we have been inform a vigilant he
open boast of it and said he knew all that they knew he was
never accus or even suspect of either murder or robberi
commit in this territori the latter crime was never laid to his
charg in ani place but that he had kill sever men in other
local was notori and his bad reput in this respect was
a most power argument in determin his fate when he was
final arrest for the offenc abov mention on return from
milk river he becam more and more addict to drink until at
last it was a common feat for him and his friend to take the
town  he and a coupl of his depend might often be seen on one
hors gallop through the street shout and yell fire
revolv etc on mani occas he would ride his hors into
store break up bar toss the scale out of door and use most
insult languag to parti present just previous to the day of
his arrest he had given a fear beat to one of his follow
but such was his influenc over them that the man wept bitter at
the gallow and beg for his life with all his power it had
becom quit common when slade was on a spree for the shopkeep
and citizen to close the store and put out all the light be
fear of some outrag at his hand for his wanton destruct of
good and furnitur he was alway readi to pay when sober if he
had money but there were not a few who regard payment as small
satisfact for the outrag and these men were his person
enemi

from time to time slade receiv warn from men that he well knew
would not deceiv him of the certain end of his conduct there was
not a moment for week previous to his arrest in which the public
did not expect to hear of some bloodi outrag the dread of his
veri name and the presenc of the arm band of hangerson who
follow him alon prevent a resist which must certain have
end in the instant murder or mutil of the oppos parti

slade was frequent arrest by order of the court whose
organ we have describ and had treat it with respect by
pay one or two fine and promis to pay the rest when he had
money but in the transact that occur at this crisi he
forgot even this caution and goad by passion and the hatr of
restraint he sprang into the embrac of death

slade had been drunk and cut up all night he and his
companion had made the town a perfect hell in the morn j m
fox the sheriff met him arrest him took him into court and
commenc read a warrant that he had for his arrest by way of
arraign he becam uncontrol furious and seiz the
writ he tore it up threw it on the ground and stamp upon it

the click of the lock of his companion revolv was instant
heard and a crisi was expect the sheriff did not attempt his
retent but be at least as prudent as he was valiant he
succumb leav slade the master of the situat and the
conqueror and ruler of the court law and lawmak this was a
declar of war and was so accept the vigil committe
now felt that the question of social order and the preponder of
the lawabid citizen had then and there to be decid they
knew the charact of slade and they were well awar that they must
submit to his rule without murmur or els that he must be dealt
with in such fashion as would prevent his be abl to wreak his
vengeanc on the committe who could never have hope to live in
the territori secur from outrag or death and who could never
leav it without encount his friend whom his victori would
have embolden and stimul to a pitch that would have render
them reckless of consequ the day previous he had ridden into
dorri store and on be request to leav he drew his
revolv and threaten to kill the gentleman who spoke to him
anoth saloon he had led his hors into and buy a bottl of
wine he tri to make the anim drink it this was not consid
an uncommon perform as he had often enter saloon and
commenc fire at the lamp caus a wild stamped

a lead member of the committe met slade and inform him in the
quiet earnest manner of one who feel the import of what he is
say slade get your hors at onc and go home or there will
be  to pay  slade start and took a long look with his dark
and pierc eye at the gentleman what do you mean  said he
you have no right to ask me what i mean  was the quiet repli get
your hors at onc and rememb what i tell you  after a short
paus he promis to do so and actual got into the saddl but
be still intox he began call aloud to one after anoth
of his friend and at last seem to have forgotten the warn he
had receiv and becam again uproari shout the name of a
wellknown courtezan in compani with those of two men whom he
consid head of the committe as a sort of challeng perhap
howev as a simpl act of bravado it seem probabl that the
intim of person danger he had receiv had not been forgotten
entir though fatal for him he took a foolish way of show
his remembr of it he sought out alexand davi the judg of
the court and draw a cock derring he present it at his
head and told him that he should hold him as a hostag for his own
safeti as the judg stood perfect quiet and offer no
resist to his captor no further outrag follow on this score
previous to this on account of the critic state of affair the
committe had met and at last resolv to arrest him his
execut had not been agre upon and at that time would have
been negativ most assur a messeng rode down to nevada to
inform the lead men of what was on hand as it was desir to

the gulch

the miner turn out almost en mass leav their work and

plain that the miner meant busi  and that if they came up
they would not stand in the street to be shot down by slade
friend but that they would take him and hang him the meet was
small as the virginia men were loath to act at all this moment
announc of the feel of the lower town was made to a cluster
of men who were deliber behind a wagon at the rear of a store
on main street

the committe were most unwil to proceed to extrem all
the duti they had ever perform seem as noth to the task
befor them but they had to decid and that quick it was
final agre that if the whole bodi of the miner were of the
opinion that he should be hang that the committe left it in
their hand to deal with him off at hot speed rode the leader of
the nevada men to join his command

slade had found out what was intend and the news sober him
instant he went into p s pfout store where davi was and
apolog for his conduct say that he would take it all back

the head of the column now wheel into wallac street and march
up at quick time halt in front of the store the execut

chapter xii

just beyond the breakfastst we overtook a mormon emigr train of
thirtythre wagon and tramp wearili along and drive their herd of
loos cow were dozen of coarseclad and sadlook men women and
children who had walk as they were walk now day after day for
eight linger week and in that time had compass the distanc our
stage had come in eight day and three hoursseven hundr and
ninetyeight mile they were dusti and uncomb hatless bonnetless
and rag and they did look so tire

after breakfast we bath in hors creek a previous limpid
sparkl streaman appreci luxuri for it was veri seldom that our
furious coach halt long enough for an indulg of that kind we
chang hors ten or twelv time in everi twentyfour hourschang
mule rathersix mulesand did it near everi time in four minut
it was live work as our coach rattl up to each station six
har mule step gayli from the stabl and in the twinkl of an
eye almost the old team was out and the new one in and we off and away
again

dure the afternoon we pass sweetwat creek independ rock
devil gate and the devil gap the latter were wild specimen of
rug sceneri and full of interestw were in the heart of the rocki
mountain now and we also pass by alkali or soda lake  and we
woke up to the fact that our journey had stretch a long way across the
world when the driver said that the mormon often came there from great
salt lake citi to haul away saleratus he said that a few day gone by
they had shovel up enough pure saleratus from the ground it was a dri
lake to load two wagon and that when they got these two wagonsload
of a drug that cost them noth to salt lake they could sell it for
twentyf cent a pound

in the night we sail by a most notabl curios and one we had been
hear a good deal about for a day or two and were suffer to see
this was what might be call a natur icehous it was august now
and swelter weather in the daytim yet at one of the station the men
could scape the soil on the hillsid under the lee of a rang of
boulder and at a depth of six inch cut out pure block of icehard
compact frozen and clear as crystal

toward dawn we got under way again and present as we sat with rais
curtain enjoy our earlymorn smoke and contempl the first
splendor of the rise sun as it swept down the long array of mountain
peak flush and gild crag after crag and summit after summit as
if the invis creator review his gray veteran and they salut with
a smile we hove in sight of south pass citi the hotelkeep the
postmast the blacksmith the mayor the constabl the citi marshal
and the princip citizen and properti holder all came out and greet
us cheerili and we gave him good day he gave us a littl indian news
and a littl rocki mountain news and we gave him some plain inform
in return he then retir to his lone grandeur and we climb on up
among the bristl peak and the rag cloud south pass citi
consist of four log cabin one if which was unfinish and the
gentleman with all those offic and titl was the chiefest of the ten
citizen of the place think of hotelkeep postmast blacksmith
mayor constabl citi marshal and princip citizen all condens into
one person and cram into one skin bemi said he was a perfect
allen revolv of digniti  and he said that if he were to die as
postmast or as blacksmith or as postmast and blacksmith both the
peopl might stand it but if he were to die all over it would be a
fright loss to the communiti

two mile beyond south pass citi we saw for the first time that
mysteri marvel which all western untravel boy have heard of and
fulli believ in but are sure to be astound at when they see it with
their own eye neverthelessbank of snow in dead summer time we were
now far up toward the sky and knew all the time that we must present
encount lofti summit clad in the etern snow which was so common
place a matter of mention in book and yet when i did see it glitter
in the sun on state dome in the distanc and knew the month was august
and that my coat was hang up becaus it was too warm to wear it i was
full as much amaz as if i never had heard of snow in august befor
truli see is believingand mani a man live a long life through
think he believ certain univers receiv and well establish
thing and yet never suspect that if he were confront by those thing
onc he would discov that he did not realli believ them befor but
onli thought he believ them

in a littl while quit a number of peak swung into view with long claw
of glitter snow clasp them and with here and there in the shade
down the mountain side a littl solitari patch of snow look no larger
than a ladi pockethandkerchief but be in realiti as larg as a
public squar 

and now at last we were fair in the renown south pass and whirl
gayli along high abov the common world we were perch upon the
extrem summit of the great rang of the rocki mountain toward which we
had been climb patient climb ceaseless climb for day and
night togetherand about us was gather a convent of natur king
that stood ten twelv and even thirteen thousand feet highgrand old
fellow who would have to stoop to see mount washington in the twilight
we were in such an airi elev abov the creep popul of the
earth that now and then when the obstruct crag stood out of the way
it seem that we could look around and abroad and contempl the whole
great globe with it dissolv view of mountain sea and contin
stretch away through the mysteri of the summer haze

as a general thing the pass was more suggest of a valley than a
suspens bridg in the cloudsbut it strong suggest the latter at
one spot at that place the upper third of one or two majest purpl
dome project abov our level on either hand and gave us a sens of a
hidden great deep of mountain and plain and valley down about their
base which we fanci we might see if we could step to the edg and look
over these sultan of the fast were turban with tumbl volum
of cloud which shred away from time to time and drift off fring
and torn trail their contin of shadow after them and catch
present on an intercept peak wrap it about and brood there
then shred away again and left the purpl peak as they had left the
purpl dome downi and white with newlaid snow in pass these
monstrous rag of cloud hung low and swept along right over the
spectat head swing their tatter so near in his face that his
impuls was to shrink when they came closet in the one place i speak
of one could look below him upon a world of diminish crag and
canyon lead down down and away to a vagu plain with a thread in it
which was a road and bunch of feather in it which were tree a
pretti pictur sleep in the sunlightbut with a dark steal
over it and gloom it featur deeper and deeper under the frown of a
come storm and then while no film or shadow mar the noon
bright of his high perch he could watch the tempest break forth down
there and see the lightn leap from crag to crag and the sheet rain
drive along the canyonsid and hear the thunder peal and crash and
roar we had this spectacl a familiar one to mani but to us a
novelti

we bowl along cheerili and present at the veri summit though it
had been all summit to us and all equal level for half an hour or
more we came to a spring which spent it water through two outlet and
sent it in opposit direct the conductor said that one of those
stream which we were look at was just start on a journey westward
to the gulf of california and the pacif ocean through hundr and
even thousand of mile of desert solitud he said that the other was
just leav it home among the snowpeak on a similar journey eastward
and we knew that long after we should have forgotten the simpl rivulet
it would still be plod it patient way down the mountain side and
canyonb and between the bank of the yellowston and by and by
would join the broad missouri and flow through unknown plain and desert
and unvisit wilder and add a long and troubl pilgrimag among
snag and wreck and sandbar and enter the mississippi touch the
wharv of st loui and still drift on travers shoal and rocki
channel then endless chain of bottomless and ampl bend wall with
unbroken forest then mysteri byway and secret passag among woodi
island then the chain bend again border with wide level of
shine sugarcan in place of the sombr forest then by new orlean
and still other chain of bendsand final after two long month of
daili and night harass excit enjoy adventur and aw
peril of parch throat pump and evapor pass the gulf and enter
into it rest upon the bosom of the tropic sea never to look upon it
snowpeak again or regret them

i freight a leaf with a mental messag for the friend at home and
drop it in the stream but i put no stamp on it and it was held for
postag somewher

on the summit we overtook an emigr train of mani wagon mani tire
men and women and mani a disgust sheep and cow

in the wofulli dusti horseman in charg of the expedit i recogn
john  of all person in the world to meet on top of the rocki
mountain thousand of mile from home he was the last one i should have
look for we were schoolboy togeth and warm friend for year
but a boyish prank of mine had disruptur this friendship and it had
never been renew the act of which i speak was this i had been
accustom to visit occasion an editor whose room was in the third
stori of a build and overlook the street one day this editor gave
me a watermelon which i made prepar to devour on the spot but
chanc to look out of the window i saw john stand direct under it
and an irresist desir came upon me to drop the melon on his head
which i immedi did i was the loser for it spoil the melon and
john never forgav me and we drop all intercours and part but now
met again under these circumst

we recogn each other simultan and hand were grasp as warm
as if no cold had ever exist between us and no allus was made
to ani all animos were buri and the simpl fact of meet a
familiar face in that isol spot so far from home was suffici to
make us forget all thing but pleasant one and we part again with
sincer goodbye and god bless you from both

we had been climb up the long shoulder of the rocki mountain for
mani tedious hoursw start down them now and we went spin away
at a round rate too

we left the snowi wind river mountain and uinta mountain behind and
sped away alway through splendid sceneri but occasion through long
rank of white skeleton of mule and oxenmonu of the huge
emigr of other daysand here and there were upend board or
small pile of stone which the driver said mark the restingplac of
more precious remain

it was the loneliest land for a grave a land given over to the cayot
and the ravenwhich is but anoth name for desol and utter
solitud on damp murki night these scatter skeleton gave forth a
soft hideous glow like veri faint spot of moonlight star the vagu
desert it was becaus of the phosphorus in the bone but no
scientif explan could keep a bodi from shiver when he drift
by one of those ghost light and knew that a skull held it

at midnight it began to rain and i never saw anyth like itinde i
did not even see this for it was too dark we fasten down the
curtain and even caulk them with cloth but the rain stream in in
twenti place nothwithstand there was no escap if one move his
feet out of a stream he brought his bodi under one and if he move his
bodi he caught one somewher els if he struggl out of the drench
blanket and sat up he was bound to get one down the back of his neck
meantim the stage was wander about a plain with gape gulli in it
for the driver could not see an inch befor his face nor keep the road
and the storm pelt so pitiless that there was no keep the hors
still with the first abat the conductor turn out with lantern
to look for the road and the first dash he made was into a chasm about
fourteen feet deep his lantern follow like a meteor as soon as he
touch bottom he sang out frantic

dont come here 

to which the driver who was look over the precipic where he had
disappear repli with an injur air think im a dam fool 

the conductor was more than an hour find the roada matter which
show us how far we had wander and what chanc we had been take
he trace our wheeltrack to the immin verg of danger in two
place i have alway been glad that we were not kill that night
i do not know ani particular reason but i have alway been glad
in the morn the tenth day out we cross green river a fine larg
limpid streamstuck in it with the water just up to the top of our
mailb and wait till extra team were put on to haul us up the steep
bank but it was nice cool water and besid it could not find ani
fresh place on us to wet

at the green river station we had breakfasthot biscuit fresh antelop
steak and coffeeth onli decent meal we tast between the unit
state and great salt lake citi and the onli one we were ever realli
thank for

think of the monoton execr of the thirti that went befor it
to leav this one simpl breakfast loom up in my memori like a
shottow after all these year have gone by

at five p m we reach fort bridger one hundr and seventeen mile
from the south pass and one thousand and twentyf mile from st
joseph fiftytwo mile further on near the head of echo canyon we met
sixti unit state soldier from camp floyd the day befor they had
fire upon three hundr or four hundr indian whom they suppos
gather togeth for no good purpos in the fight that had ensu
four indian were captur and the main bodi chase four mile but
nobodi kill this look like busi we had a notion to get out
and join the sixti soldier but upon reflect that there were four
hundr of the indian we conclud to go on and join the indian

echo canyon is twenti mile long it was like a long smooth narrow
street with a gradual descend grade and shut in by enorm
perpendicular wall of coars conglomer four hundr feet high in
mani place and turret like mediaev castl this was the most
faultless piec of road in the mountain and the driver said he would
let his team out  he did and if the pacif express train whiz
through there now ani faster than we did then in the stagecoach i envi
the passeng the exhilar of it we fair seem to pick up our
wheel and flyand the mail matter was lift up free from everyth
and held in solut i am not given to exagger and when i say a
thing i mean it

howev time press at four in the afternoon we arriv on the summit
of big mountain fifteen mile from salt lake citi when all the world
was glorifi with the set sun and the most stupend panorama of
mountain peak yet encount burst on our sight we look out upon
this sublim spectacl from under the arch of a brilliant rainbow even
the overland stagedriv stop his hors and gaze

half an hour or an hour later we chang hors and took supper with a
mormon destroy angel 

destroy angel  as i understand it are latterday saint who are
set apart by the church to conduct perman disappear of obnoxi
citizen i had heard a deal about these mormon destroy angel and
the dark and bloodi deed they had done and when i enter this one
hous i had my shudder all readi but ala for all our romanc he was
noth but a loud profan offens old blackguard he was murder
enough possibl to fill the bill of a destroy but would you have ani
kind of an angel devoid of digniti could you abid an angel in an
unclean shirt and no suspend could you respect an angel with a
horselaugh and a swagger like a buccan

there were other blackguard presentcomrad of this one and there
was one person that look like a gentlemanheb c kimbal son tall
and well made and thirti year old perhap a lot of slattern women
flit hither and thither in a hurri with coffeepot plate of bread
and other appurten to supper and these were said to be the wive of
the angelor some of them at least and of cours they were for if
they had been hire help they would not have let an angel from abov
storm and swear at them as he did let alon one from the place this one
hail from

this was our first experi of the western peculiar institut  and
it was not veri prepossess we did not tarri long to observ it but
hurri on to the home of the latterday saint the stronghold of the
prophet the capit of the onli absolut monarch in americagreat salt
lake citi as the night close in we took sanctuari in the salt lake
hous and unpack our baggag




chapter xiii

we had a fine supper of the freshest meat and fowl and vegetablesa
great varieti and as great abund we walk about the street some
afterward and glanc in at shop and store and there was fascin
in surreptiti stare at everi creatur we took to be a mormon
this was fairyland to us to all intent and purposesa land of
enchant and goblin and aw mysteri we felt a curios to ask
everi child how mani mother it had and if it could tell them apart and
we experienc a thrill everi time a dwellinghous door open and shut
as we pass disclos a glimps of human head and back and
shouldersfor we so long to have a good satisfi look at a mormon
famili in all it comprehens ampl dispos in the customari
concentr ring of it home circl

by and by the act governor of the territori introduc us to other
gentil  and we spent a sociabl hour with them gentiles are
peopl who are not mormon our fellowpasseng bemi took care of
himself dure this part of the even and did not make an
overpow success of it either for he came into our room in the
hotel about eleven oclock full of cheer and talk loos
disjoint and indiscrimin and everi now and then tug out a
rag word by the root that had more hiccup than syllabl in it
this togeth with his hang his coat on the floor on one side of a
chair and his vest on the floor on the other side and pile his pant
on the floor just in front of the same chair and then comtempl the
general result with superstiti awe and final pronounc it too
mani for him and go to bed with his boot on led us to fear that
someth he had eaten had not agre with him

but we knew afterward that it was someth he had been drink it was
the exclus mormon refresh valley tan 

valley tan or at least one form of valley tan is a kind of whiski
or first cousin to it is of mormon invent and manufactur onli in
utah tradit say it is made of import fire and brimston if i
rememb right no public drink saloon were allow in the kingdom
by brigham young and no privat drink permit among the faith
except they confin themselv to valley tan 

next day we stroll about everywher through the broad straight level
street and enjoy the pleasant strang of a citi of fifteen
thousand inhabit with no loafer percept in it and no visibl
drunkard or noisi peopl a limpid stream rippl and danc through

grand general air of neat repair thrift and comfort around and
about and over the whole and everywher were workshop factori and
all manner of industri and intent face and busi hand were to be seen

the armori crest of my own state consist of two dissolut bear
hold up the head of a dead and gone cask between them and make the
pertin remark unit we stand hic divid we fall  it was
alway too figur for the author of this book but the mormon crest
was easi and it was simpl unostentati and fit like a glove
it was a represent of a golden beehiv with the bee all at work

the citi lie in the edg of a level plain as broad as the state of
connecticut and crouch close down to the ground under a curv wall
of mighti mountain whose head are hidden in the cloud and whose
shoulder bear relic of the snow of winter all the summer long

seen from one of these dizzi height twelv or fifteen mile off great
salt lake citi is tone down and diminish till it is suggest of a

on some of those mountain to the southwest it had been rain everi
day for two week but not a drop had fallen in the citi and on hot
day in late spring and earli autumn the citizen could quit fan and
growl and go out and cool off by look at the luxuri of a glorious
snowstorm go on in the mountain they could enjoy it at a distanc
at those season everi day though no snow would fall in their street
or anywher near them

salt lake citi was healthyan extrem healthi citi

they declar there was onli one physician in the place and he was
arrest everi week regular and held to answer under the vagrant act
for have no visibl mean of support  they alway give you a good
substanti articl of truth in salt lake and good measur and good
weight too veri often if you wish to weigh one of their airiest
littl commonplac statement you would want the hay scale 

we desir to visit the famous inland sea the american dead sea  the
great salt lakeseventeen mile horseback from the cityfor we had
dream about it and thought about it and talk about it and yearn
to see it all the first part of our trip but now when it was onli arm
length away it had sudden lost near everi bit of it interest and
so we put it off in a sort of general way till next dayand that was
the last we ever thought of it we dine with some hospit gentil
and visit the foundat of the prodigi templ and talk long with
that shrewd connecticut yanke heber c kimbal sinc deceas a

by and by i subsid into an indign silenc and so sat until the end
hot and flush and execr him in my heart for an ignor savag
but he was calm his convers with those gentlemen flow on as
sweet and peac and music as ani summer brook when the
audienc was end and we were retir from the presenc he put his

chapter xiv

mr street was veri busi with his telegraph mattersand consid
that he had eight or nine hundr mile of rug snowi uninhabit
mountain and waterless treeless melancholi desert to travers with
his wire it was natur and need that he should be as busi as
possibl he could not go comfort along and cut his pole by the
roadsid either but they had to be haul by ox team across those
exhaust desertsand it was two day journey from water to water in
one or two of them mr street contract was a vast work everi way one
look at it and yet to comprehend what the vagu word eight hundr
mile of rug mountain and dismal deserts mean one must go over the
ground in personpen and ink descript cannot convey the dreari
realiti to the reader and after all mr s s mightiest difficulti
turn out to be one which he had never taken into the account at all
unto mormon he had sublet the hardest and heaviest half of his great
undertak and all of a sudden they conclud that they were go to
make littl or noth and so they tranquilli threw their pole
overboard in mountain or desert just as it happen when they took the
notion and drove home and went about their customari busi they
were under written contract to mr street but they did not care anyth
for that they said they would admire to see a gentile forc a
mormon to fulfil a lose contract in utah and they made themselv
veri merri over the matter street saidfor it was he that told us
these thing

i was in dismay i was under heavi bond to complet my contract in a
given time and this disast look veri much like ruin it was an
astound thing it was such a wholli unlookedfor difficulti that i
was entir nonpluss i am a busi manhav alway been a
busi mando not know anyth but businessand so you can imagin
how like be struck by lightn it was to find myself in a countri
where written contract were worthless that main secur that
sheetanchor that absolut necess of busi my confid left
me there was no use in make new contractsthat was plain i talk
with first one promin citizen and then anoth they all sympath
with me first rate but they did not know how to help me but at last a
gentil said go to brigham young these small fri cannot do you ani
good  i did not think much of the idea for if the law could not help
me what could an individu do who had not even anyth to do with
either make the law or execut them he might be a veri good
patriarch of a church and preacher in it tabernacl but someth
sterner than religion and moral suasion was need to handl a hundr
refractori halfcivil subcontractor but what was a man to do i
thought if mr young could not do anyth els he might probabl be
abl to give me some advic and a valuabl hint or two and so i went
straight to him and laid the whole case befor him he said veri littl
but he show strong interest all the way through he examin all the
paper in detail and whenev there seem anyth like a hitch either
in the paper or my statement he would go back and take up the thread
and follow it patient out to an intellig and satisfactori result
then he made a list of the contractor name final he said

mr street this is all perfect plain these contract are strict
and legal drawn and are duli sign and certifi these men
manifest enter into them with their eye open i see no fault or
flaw anywher 

then mr young turn to a man wait at the other end of the room and
said take this list of name to soandso and tell him to have these
men here at suchandsuch an hour 

they were there to the minut so was i mr young ask them a
number of question and their answer made my statement good then he
said to them

you sign these contract and assum these oblig of your own
free will and accord 

ye 

then carri them out to the letter if it make pauper of you go 

and they did go too they are strung across the desert now work
like bee and i never hear a word out of them

there is a batch of governor and judg and other offici here
ship from washington and they maintain the semblanc of a republican
form of governmentbut the petrifi truth is that utah is an absolut
monarchi and brigham young is king 

mr street was a fine man and i believ his stori i knew him well
dure sever year afterward in san francisco

our stay in salt lake citi amount to onli two day and therefor we
had no time to make the customari inquisit into the work of
polygami and get up the usual statist and deduct preparatori to
call the attent of the nation at larg onc more to the matter

i had the will to do it with the gush selfsuffici of youth i
was feverish to plung in headlong and achiev a great reform hereuntil
i saw the mormon women then i was touch my heart was wiser than my
head it warm toward these poor ungain and pathet homely
creatur and as i turn to hide the generous moistur in my eye i
said noth man that marri one of them has done an act of christian

chapter xv

it is a luscious countri for thrill even stori about
assassin of intract gentil i cannot easili conceiv of
anyth more cosi than the night in salt lake which we spent in a
gentil den smoke pipe and listen to tale of how burton gallop
in among the plead and defenceless morisites and shot them down men
and women like so mani dog and how bill hickman a destroy angel
shot drown and arnold dead for bring suit against him for a debt
and how porter rockwel did this and that dread thing and how
heedless peopl often come to utah and make remark about brigham or
polygami or some other sacr matter and the veri next morn at
daylight such parti are sure to be found lie up some back alley
content wait for the hears

and the next most interest thing is to sit and listen to these
gentil talk about polygami and how some port old frog of an elder
or a bishop marri a girllik her marri her sisterlik her
marri anoth sisterlik her take anotherlik her marri her
motherlik her marri her father grandfath great grandfath
and then come back hungri and ask for more and how the pert young
thing of eleven will chanc to be the favorit wife and her own vener
grandmoth have to rank away down toward d  in their mutual husband
esteem and have to sleep in the kitchen as like as not and how this
dread sort of thing this hive togeth in one foul nest of mother
and daughter and the make a young daughter superior to her own mother
in rank and author are thing which mormon women submit to becaus
their religion teach them that the more wive a man has on earth and
the more children he rear the higher the place they will all have in
the world to comeand the warmer mayb though they do not seem to say
anyth about that

old and gone out of activ servic but were comfort hous and care
for in the heneryor the lion hous as it is strang name along

their meal in one room and a happi and homelik sight it was
pronounc to be none of our parti got an opportun to take dinner
with mr young but a gentil by the name of johnson profess to have
enjoy a sociabl breakfast in the lion hous he gave a preposter
account of the call of the roll  and other preliminari and the

of certain of his twoyearold  observ with some pride that for
mani year he had been the heaviest contributor in that line to one of
the eastern magazin and then he want to show mr johnson one of the
pet that had said the last good thing but he could not find the child

he search the face of the children in detail but could not decid

i thought i would know the littl cub again but i dont  mr johnson
said further that mr young observ that life was a sad sad thing
becaus the joy of everi new marriag a man contract was so apt to be
blight by the inopportun funer of a less recent bride  and mr
johnson said that while he and mr young were pleasant convers in
privat one of the mrs young came in and demand a breastpin
remark that she had found out that he had been give a breastpin to

the state of thing insid the hous was not agreeabl to the stranger
he could find room outsid mr young promis the breastpin and she
went away but in a minut or two anoth mrs young came in and
demand a breastpin mr young began a remonstr but mrs young
cut him short she said no  had got one and no  was promis one

some instinct or other made me set this johnson down as be unreli

inform he gave us could have been acquir from ani other sourc
he was a pleasant contrast to those retic mormon




chapter xvi

all men have heard of the mormon bibl but few except the elect have
seen it or at least taken the troubl to read it i brought away a
copi from salt lake the book is a curios to me it is such a
pretenti affair and yet so slow  so sleepi such an insipid mess of
inspir it is chloroform in print if joseph smith compos this
book the act was a miraclekeep awak while he did it was at ani
rate if he accord to tradit mere translat it from certain
ancient and mysteriouslyengrav plate of copper which he declar he
found under a stone in an outoftheway local the work of
translat was equal a miracl for the same reason

the book seem to be mere a prosi detail of imaginari histori with the
old testament for a model follow by a tedious plagiar of the new
testament the author labor to give his word and phrase the quaint
oldfashion sound and structur of our king jame translat of the
scriptur and the result is a mongrelhalf modern glib and half
ancient simplic and graviti the latter is awkward and constrain
the former natur but grotesqu by the contrast whenev he found his
speech grow too modernwhich was about everi sentenc or twoh
ladl in a few such scriptur phrase as exceed sore  and it came
to pass  etc and made thing satisfactori again and it came to
pass was his pet if he had left that out his bibl would have been
onli a pamphlet

the titlepag read as follow

the book of mormon an account written by the hand of mormon upon
plate taken from the plate of nephi

wherefor it is an abridg of the record of the peopl of nephi
and also of the lamanit written to the lamanit who are a
remnant of the hous of israel and also to jew and gentil written
by way of command and also by the spirit of propheci and of
revel written and seal up and hid up unto the lord that
they might not be destroy to come forth by the gift and power of
god unto the interpret thereof seal by the hand of moroni
and hid up unto the lord to come forth in due time by the way of
gentil the interpret thereof by the gift of god an
abridg taken from the book of ether also which is a record of
the peopl of jare who were scatter at the time the lord
confound the languag of the peopl when they were build a
tower to get to heaven

hid up is good and so is whereforethough whi wherefore ani
other word would have answer as wellthoughin truth it would not
have sound so scriptur

next come

the testimoni of three wit
be it known unto all nation kindr tongu and peopl unto
whom this work shall come that we through the grace of god the
father and our lord jesus christ have seen the plate which
contain this record which is a record of the peopl of nephi and
also of the lamanit their brethren and also of the peopl of
jare who came from the tower of which hath been spoken and we
also know that they have been translat by the gift and power of
god for his voic hath declar it unto us wherefor we know of a
sureti that the work is true and we also testifi that we have seen
the engrav which are upon the plate and they have been shown
unto us by the power of god and not of man and we declar with
word of sober that an angel of god came down from heaven and
he brought and laid befor our eye that we beheld and saw the
plate and the engrav thereon and we know that it is by the
grace of god the father and our lord jesus christ that we beheld
and bear record that these thing are true and it is marvel in
our eye nevertheless the voic of the lord command us that we
should bear record of it wherefor to be obedi unto the
command of god we bear testimoni of these thing and we know
that if we are faith in christ we shall rid our garment of the
blood of all men and be found spotless befor the judgmentseat of
christ and shall dwell with him etern in the heaven and the
honor be to the father and to the son and to the holi ghost which
is one god amen

some peopl have to have a world of evid befor they can come
anywher in the neighborhood of believ anyth but for me when a
man tell me that he has seen the engrav which are upon the plate 
and not onli that but an angel was there at the time and saw him see
them and probabl took his receipt for it i am veri far on the road to
convict no matter whether i ever heard of that man befor or not and
even if i do not know the name of the angel or his nation either

next is this

and also the testimoni of eight wit
be it known unto all nation kindr tongu and peopl unto
whom this work shall come that joseph smith jr the translat of
this work has shown unto us the plate of which hath been spoken
which have the appear of gold and as mani of the leav as the
said smith has translat we did handl with our hand and we also
saw the engrav thereon all of which has the appear of
ancient work and of curious workmanship and this we bear record
with word of sober that the said smith has shown unto us for
we have seen and heft and know of a sureti that the said smith
has got the plate of which we have spoken and we give our name

the mormon bibl consist of fifteen booksb the book of jacob
eno jarom omni mosiah zeniff alma helaman ether moroni two
books of mormon and three of nephi

in the first book of nephi is a plagiar of the old testament which
give an account of the exodus from jerusalem of the children of lehi
and it goe on to tell of their wander in the wilder dure
eight year and their supernatur protect by one of their number a
parti by the name of nephi they final reach the land of
bounti  and camp by the sea after they had remain there for
the space of mani dayswhich is more scriptur than definitenephi
was command from on high to build a ship wherein to carri the peopl
across the water  he travesti noah arkbut he obey order in
the matter of the plan he finish the ship in a singl day while his
brethren stood by and made fun of itand of him toosay our
brother is a fool for he thinketh that he can build a ship  they did
not wait for the timber to dri but the whole tribe or nation sail the
next day then a bit of genuin natur crop out and is reveal by
outspoken nephi with scriptur franknessthey all got on a spree
they and also their wive began to make themselv merri insomuch
that they began to danc and to sing and to speak with much rude
yea they were lift up unto exceed rude 

nephi tri to stop these scandal proceed but they tie him neck
and heel and went on with their lark but observ how nephi the
prophet circumv them by the aid of the invis power

and it came to pass that after they had bound me insomuch that i
could not move the compass which had been prepar of the lord
did ceas to work wherefor they knew not whither they should
steer the ship insomuch that there aros a great storm yea a
great and terribl tempest and we were driven back upon the water
for the space of three day and they began to be frighten
exceed lest they should be drown in the sea nevertheless
they did not loos me and on the fourth day which we had been
driven back the tempest began to be exceed sore and it came to
pass that we were about to be swallow up in the depth of the sea

then they unti him

and it came to pass after they had loos me behold i took the
compass and it did work whither i desir it and it came to pass
that i pray unto the lord and after i had pray the wind did
ceas and the storm did ceas and there was a great calm

equip with their compass these ancient appear to have had the
advantag of noah

their voyag was toward a promis landth onli name they give it
they reach it in safeti

polygami is a recent featur in the mormon religion and was ad by
brigham young after joseph smith death befor that it was regard
as an abomin  this vers from the mormon bibl occur in chapter
ii of the book of jacob

for behold thus saith the lord this peopl begin to wax in
iniqu they understand not the scriptur for they seek to
excus themselv in commit whoredom becaus of the thing
which were written concern david and solomon his son behold
david and solomon truli had mani wive and concubin which thing
was abomin befor me saith the lord wherefor thus saith the
lord i have led this peopl forth out of the land of jerusalem by
the power of mine arm that i might rais up unto me a righteous
branch from the fruit of the loin of joseph wherefor i the lord
god will no suffer that this peopl shall do like unto them of old

howev the project failedor at least the modern mormon end of itfor
brigham suffers it this vers is from the same chapter

behold the lamanit your brethren whom ye hate becaus of their
filthi and the curs which hath come upon their skin are
more righteous than you for they have not forgotten the command
of the lord which was given unto our father that they should
have save it were one wife and concubin they should have none

the follow vers from chapter ix of the book of nephi appear to
contain inform not familiar to everybodi

and now it came to pass that when jesus had ascend into heaven
the multitud did dispers and everi man did take his wife and his
children and did return to his own home

and it came to pass that on the morrow when the multitud was
gather togeth behold nephi and his brother whom he had rais
from the dead whose name was timothi and also his son whose name
was jona and also mathoni and mathonihah his brother and kumen
and kumenenhi and jeremiah and shemnon and jona and zedekiah
and isaiah now these were the name of the discipl whom jesus had
chosen

in order that the reader may observ how much more grandeur and
picturesqu as seen by these mormon twelv accompani on of the
tenderest episod in the life of our saviour than other eye seem to
have been awar of i quot the follow from the same booknephi

and it came to pass that jesus spake unto them and bade them aris
and they aros from the earth and he said unto them bless are ye
becaus of your faith and now behold my joy is full and when he
had said these word he wept and the multitud bear record of it
and he took their littl children one by one and bless them and
pray unto the father for them and when he had done this he wept
again and he spake unto the multitud and saith unto them behold
your littl one and as they look to behold they cast their
eye toward heaven and they saw the heaven open and they saw
angel descend out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire
and they came down and encircl those littl one about and they
were encircl about with fire and the angel did minist unto
them and the multitud did see and hear and bear record and they
know that their record is true for they all of them did see and
hear everi man for himself and they were in number about two
thousand and five hundr soul and they did consist of men women
and children

and what els would they be like to consist of

the book of ether is an incomprehens medley of if histori  much of
it relat to battl and sieg among peopl whom the reader has
possibl never heard of and who inhabit a countri which is not set
down in the geographi these was a king with the remark name of
coriantumr  and he war with share and lib and shiz and other
in the plain of heshlon and the valley of gilgal and the
wilder of akish and the land of moran and the plain of
agosh and ogath  and ramah  and the land of corihor  and the
hill comnor  by the water of ripliancum  etc etc etc and it
came to pass  after a deal of fight that coriantumr upon make
calcul of his loss found that there had been slain two million
of mighti men and also their wive and their childrensay    or
   in alland he began to sorrow in his heart  unquestion
it was time so he wrote to shiz ask a cessat of hostil and
offer to give up his kingdom to save his peopl shiz declin
except upon condit that coriantumr would come and let him cut his head
off firsta thing which coriantumr would not do then there was more
fight for a season then four year were devot to gather the
forc for a final struggleaft which ensu a battl which i take
it is the most remark set forth in histori except perhap that
of the kilkenni cat which it resembl in some respect this is the
account of the gather and the battl

 and it came to pass that they did gather togeth all the
peopl upon all the face of the land who had not been slain save
it was ether and it came to pass that ether did behold all the
do of the peopl and he beheld that the peopl who were for
coriantumr were gather togeth to the armi of coriantumr and
the peopl who were for shiz were gather togeth to the armi of
shiz wherefor they were for the space of four year gather
togeth the peopl that they might get all who were upon the face
of the land and that they might receiv all the strength which it
was possibl that they could receiv and it came to pass that when
they were all gather togeth everi one to the armi which he
would with their wive and their children both men women and
children be arm with weapon of war have shield and
breastplat and headplat and be cloth after the manner
of war they did march forth one against anoth to battl and
they fought all that day and conquer not and it came to pass
that when it was night they were weari and retir to their camp
and after they had retir to their camp they took up a howl
and a lament for the loss of the slain of their peopl and so
great were their cri their howl and lament that it did
rend the air exceed and it came to pass that on the morrow
they did go again to battl and great and terribl was that day
nevertheless they conquer not and when the night came again they
did rend the air with their cri and their howl and their
mourn for the loss of the slain of their peopl

 and it came to pass that coriantumr wrote again an epistl unto
shiz desir that he would not come again to battl but that he
would take the kingdom and spare the live of the peopl but
behold the spirit of the lord had ceas strive with them and
satan had full power over the heart of the peopl for they were
given up unto the hard of their heart and the blind of
their mind that they might be destroy wherefor they went again
to battl and it came to pass that they fought all that day and
when the night came they slept upon their sword and on the morrow
they fought even until the night came and when the night came they
were drunken with anger even as a man who is drunken with wine and
they slept again upon their sword and on the morrow they fought
again and when the night came they had all fallen by the sword save
it were fifti and two of the peopl of coriantumr and sixti and
nine of the peopl of shiz and it came to pass that they slept
upon their sword that night and on the morrow they fought again
and they contend in their might with their sword and with their
shield all that day and when the night came there were thirti and
two of the peopl of shiz and twenti and seven of the peopl of
coriantumr

 and it came to pass that they ate and slept and prepar for
death on the morrow and they were larg and mighti men as to the
strength of men and it came to pass that they fought for the space
of three hour and they faint with the loss of blood and it
came to pass that when the men of coriantumr had receiv suffici
strength that they could walk they were about to flee for their
live but behold shiz aros and also his men and he swore in his
wrath that he would slay coriantumr or he would perish by the
sword wherefor he did pursu them and on the morrow he did
overtak them and they fought again with the sword and it came to
pass that when they had all fallen by the sword save it were
coriantumr and shiz behold shiz had faint with loss of blood
and it came to pass that when coriantumr had lean upon his sword
that he rest a littl he smote off the head of shiz and it came
to pass that after he had smote off the head of shiz that shiz
rais upon his hand and fell and after that he had struggl for
breath he die and it came to pass that coriantumr fell to the
earth and becam as if he had no life and the lord spake unto
ether and said unto him go forth and he went forth and beheld
that the word of the lord had all been fulfil and he finish
his record and the hundredth part i have not written

it seem a piti he did not finish for after all his dreari former
chapter of commonplac he stop just as he was in danger of becom
interest

the mormon bibl is rather stupid and tiresom to read but there is
noth vicious in it teach it code of moral is unobjection
it is smouched milton from the new testament and no credit given




chapter xvii

at the end of our two day sojourn we left great salt lake citi hearti
and well fed and happyphys superb but not so veri much wiser as
regard the mormon question  than we were when we arriv perhap
we had a deal more information than we had befor of cours but we
did not know what portion of it was reliabl and what was notfor it all
came from acquaint of a daystrang strict speak we were
told for instanc that the dread mountain meadow massacre was the
work of the indian entir and that the gentil had mean tri to
fasten it upon the mormon we were told likewis that the indian were
to blame part and part the mormon and we were told likewis and
just as posit that the mormon were almost if not wholli and
complet respons for that most treacher and pitiless butcheri
we got the stori in all these differ shape but it was not till
sever year afterward that mrs wait book the mormon prophet 
came out with judg cradlebaugh trial of the accus parti in it and
reveal the truth that the latter version was the correct one and that
the mormon were the assassin all our information had three side to
it and so i gave up the idea that i could settl the mormon question
in two day still i have seen newspap correspond do it in one

i left great salt lake a good deal confus as to what state of thing
exist thereand sometim even question in my own mind whether a
state of thing exist there at all or not but present i rememb
with a lighten sens of relief that we had learn two or three
trivial thing there which we could be certain of and so the two day
were not wholli lost for instanc we had learn that we were at last
in a pioneer land in absolut and tangibl realiti

the high price charg for trifl were eloqu of high freight and
bewild distanc of freightag in the east in those day the
smallest money denomin was a penni and it repres the smallest
purchas quantiti of ani commod west of cincinnati the smallest
coin in use was the silver fivec piec and no smaller quantiti of an
articl could be bought than five cent worth  in overland citi the
lowest coin appear to be the tencent piec but in salt lake there did
not seem to be ani money in circul smaller than a quarter or ani
smaller quantiti purchas of ani commod than twentyf cent
worth we had alway been use to half dime and five cent worth as
the minimum of financi negoti but in salt lake if one want a
cigar it was a quarter if he want a chalk pipe it was a quarter if
he want a peach or a candl or a newspap or a shave or a littl
gentil whiskey to rub on his corn to arrest indigest and keep him
from have the toothach twentyf cent was the price everi time
when we look at the shotbag of silver now and then we seem to be
wast our substanc in riotous live but if we refer to the
expens account we could see that we had not been do anyth of the
kind

but peopl easili get reconcil to big money and big price and fond
and vain of bothit is a descent to littl coin and cheap price that
is hardest to bear and slowest to take hold upon one toler after
a month acquaint with the twentyf cent minimum the averag
human be is readi to blush everi time he think of his despic
fivec day how sunburnt with blush i use to get in gaudi nevada
everi time i thought of my first financi experi in salt lake
it was on this wise which is a favorit express of great author and
a veri neat one too but i never hear anybodi say on this wise when they
are talk a young halfbre with a complexion like a yellowjacket
ask me if i would have my boot black it was at the salt lake hous
the morn after we arriv i said yes and he black them then i
hand him a silver fivec piec with the benevol air of a person
who is confer wealth and blessed upon poverti and suffer the
yellowjacket took it with what i judg to be suppress emot and
laid it rever down in the middl of his broad hand then he began
to contempl it much as a philosoph contempl a gnat ear in the
ampl field of his microscop sever mountain teamster
stagedriv etc drew near and drop into the tableau and fell to
survey the money with that attract indiffer to formal which
is notic in the hardi pioneer present the yellowjacket hand
the half dime back to me and told me i ought to keep my money in my
pocketbook instead of in my soul and then i wouldnt get it cramp and
shrivel up so

what a roar of vulgar laughter there was i destroy the mongrel
reptil on the spot but i smile and smile all the time i was detach
his scalp for the remark he made was good for an injun 

yes we had learn in salt lake to be charg great price without
let the inward shudder appear on the surfacefor even alreadi we had
overheard and note the tenor of convers among driver conductor
and hostler and final among citizen of salt lake until we were well
awar that these superior be despis emigr  we permit no
telltal shudder and winc in our counten for we want to seem
pioneer or mormon halfbre teamster stagedriv mountain
meadow assassinsanyth in the world that the plain and utah
respect and admiredbut we were wretch asham of be
emigr  and sorri enough that we had white shirt and could not
swear in the presenc of ladi without look the other way

and mani a time in nevada afterward we had occas to rememb with
humili that we were emigr  and consequ a low and inferior
sort of creatur perhap the reader has visit utah nevada or

chapter xviii

at eight in the morn we reach the remnant and ruin of what had been
the import militari station of camp floyd  some fortyf or fifti
mile from salt lake citi at four p m we had doubl our distanc and
were nineti or a hundr mile from salt lake and now we enter upon
one of that speci of desert whose concentr hideous shame the
diffus and dilut horror of saharaan alkali desert for
sixtyeight mile there was but one break in it i do not rememb that
this was realli a break inde it seem to me that it was noth but a
water depot in the midst of the stretch of sixtyeight mile if my
memori serv me there was no well or spring at this place but the
water was haul there by mule and ox team from the further side of the
desert there was a stage station there it was fortyf mile from
the begin of the desert and twentythre from the end of it

we plow and drag and grope along the whole livelong night
and at the end of this uncomfort twelv hour we finish the
fortyfivemil part of the desert and got to the stage station where the
import water was the sun was just rise it was easi enough to
cross a desert in the night while we were asleep and it was pleasant to
reflect in the morn that we in actual person had encount an
absolut desert and could alway speak know of desert in presenc
of the ignor thenceforward and it was pleasant also to reflect that
this was not an obscur back countri desert but a veri celebr one
the metropoli itself as you may say all this was veri well and veri
comfort and satisfactorybut now we were to cross a desert in
daylight this was finenovelromanticdramat adventur
this inde was worth live for worth travel for we would
write home all about it

this enthusiasm this stern thirst for adventur wilt under the sultri
august sun and did not last abov one hour one poor littl hourand
then we were asham that we had gushed so the poetri was all in the
anticipationther is none in the realiti imagin a vast waveless
ocean stricken dead and turn to ash imagin this solemn wast tuft
with ashdust sagebush imagin the lifeless silenc and solitud
that belong to such a place imagin a coach creep like a bug through
the midst of this shoreless level and send up tumbl volum of dust
as if it were a bug that went by steam imagin this ach monotoni of
toil and plow kept up hour after hour and the shore still as far
away as ever appar imagin team driver coach and passeng so
deepli coat with ash that they are all one colorless color imagin
ashdrift roost abov moustach and eyebrow like snow accumul
on bough and bush this is the realiti of it

the sun beat down with dead blister relentless malign the
perspir is well from everi pore in man and beast but scarc a
sign of it find it way to the surfaceit is absorb befor it get
there there is not the faintest breath of air stir there is not a
merci shred of cloud in all the brilliant firmament there is not a
live creatur visibl in ani direct whither one search the blank
level that stretch it monoton mile on everi hand there is not a
soundnot a sighnot a whispernot a buzz or a whir of wing or
distant pipe of birdnot even a sob from the lost soul that doubtless
peopl that dead air and so the occasion sneez of the rest
mule and the champ of the bit grate harsh on the grim still
not dissip the spell but accent it and make one feel more
lonesom and forsaken than befor

the mule under violent swear coax and whipcrack would make
at state interv a spurt  and drag the coach a hundr or may be two
hundr yard stir up a billowi cloud of dust that roll back
envelop the vehicl to the wheeltop or higher and make it seem
afloat in a fog then a rest follow with the usual sneez and
bitchamp then anoth spurt of a hundr yard and anoth rest at
the end of it all day long we kept this up without water for the mule
and without ever chang the team at least we kept it up ten hour
which i take it is a day and a pretti honest one in an alkali desert
it was from four in the morn till two in the afternoon and it was so
hot and so close and our water canteen went dri in the middl of the
day and we got so thirsti it was so stupid and tiresom and dull and
the tedious hour did lag and drag and limp along with such a cruel
deliber it was so tri to give one watch a good long
undisturb spell and then take it out and find that it had been fool
away the time and not tri to get ahead ani the alkali dust cut
through our lip it persecut our eye it ate through the delic
membran and made our nose bleed and kept them bleedingand truli and
serious the romanc all fade far away and disappear and left the
desert trip noth but a harsh realitya thirsti swelter long
hate realiti

two mile and a quarter an hour for ten hoursthat was what we
accomplish it was hard to bring the comprehens away down to such a
snailpac as that when we had been use to make eight and ten mile
an hour when we reach the station on the farther verg of the desert
we were glad for the first time that the dictionari was along becaus
we never could have found languag to tell how glad we were in ani sort
of dictionari but an unabridg one with pictur in it but there could
not have been found in a whole librari of dictionari languag
suffici to tell how tire those mule were after their twentythre
mile pull to tri to give the reader an idea of how thirsti they were
would be to gild refin gold or paint the lili 

somehow now that it is there the quotat doe not seem to fitbut no
matter let it stay anyhow i think it is a grace and attract
thing and therefor have tri time and time again to work it in where
it would fit but could not succeed these effort have kept my mind
distract and ill at eas and made my narrat seem broken and
disjoint in place under these circumst it seem to me best to
leav it in as abov sinc this will afford at least a temporari
respit from the wear and tear of tri to lead up to this realli apt
and beauti quotat




chapter xix

on the morn of the sixteenth day out from st joseph we arriv at the
entranc of rocki canyon two hundr and fifti mile from salt lake
it was along in this wild countri somewher and far from ani habit
of white men except the stage station that we came across the
wretchedest type of mankind i have ever seen up to this write i
refer to the goshoot indian from what we could see and all we could
learn they are veri consider inferior to even the despis digger
indian of california inferior to all race of savag on our contin
inferior to even the terra del fuegan inferior to the hottentot and
actual inferior in some respect to the kytch of africa inde i
have been oblig to look the bulki volum of wood uncivil race
of men clear through in order to find a savag tribe degrad enough to
take rank with the goshoot i find but one peopl fair open to that
shame verdict it is the bosjesman bushmen of south africa such
of the goshoot as we saw along the road and hang about the station
were small lean scrawny creatur in complexion a dull black like
the ordinari american negro their face and hand bear dirt which
they had been hoard and accumul for month year and even
generat accord to the age of the proprietor a silent sneak
treacher look race take note of everyth covert like all
the other nobl red men that we do not read about and betray no
sign in their counten indol everlast patient and tireless
like all other indian prideless beggarsfor if the beggar instinct
were left out of an indian he would not go  ani more than a clock
without a pendulum hungri alway hungri and yet never refus
anyth that a hog would eat though often eat what a hog would
declin hunter but have no higher ambit than to kill and eat
jackass rabbit cricket and grasshopp and embezzl carrion from
the buzzard and cayot savag who when ask if they have the common
indian belief in a great spirit show a someth which almost amount to
emot think whiskey is refer to a thin scatter race of
almost nake black children these goshoot are who produc noth at
all and have no villag and no gather togeth into strict
defin tribal communitiesa peopl whose onli shelter is a rag cast on
a bush to keep off a portion of the snow and yet who inhabit one of the
most rocki wintri repuls wast that our countri or ani other can
exhibit

the bushmen and our goshoot are manifest descend from the selfsam
gorilla or kangaroo or norway rat whichev animaladam the
darwinian trace them to

one would as soon expect the rabbit to fight as the goshoot and yet
they use to live off the offal and refus of the station a few month
and then come some dark night when no mischief was expect and burn
down the build and kill the men from ambush as they rush out
and onc in the night they attack the stagecoach when a district
judg of nevada territori was the onli passeng and with their first
volley of arrow and a bullet or two they riddl the stage curtain
wound a hors or two and mortal wound the driver the latter was
full of pluck and so was his passeng at the driver call judg mott
swung himself out clamber to the box and seiz the rein of the team
and away they plung through the race mob of skeleton and under a
hurtl storm of missil the stricken driver had sunk down on the
boot as soon as he was wound but had held on to the rein and said he
would manag to keep hold of them until reliev

and after they were taken from his relax grasp he lay with his head
between judg mott feet and tranquilli gave direct about the road
he said he believ he could live till the miscreant were outrun and
left behind and that if he manag that the main difficulti would be at
an end and then if the judg drove so and so give direct about
bad place in the road and general cours he would reach the next
station without troubl the judg distanc the enemi and at last
rattl up to the station and knew that the night peril were done but
there was no comradeinarm for him to rejoic with for the soldier
driver was dead

let us forget that we have been say harsh thing about the overland
driver now the disgust which the goshoot gave me a discipl of
cooper and a worshipp of the red maneven of the scholar savag in
the last of the mohicans who are fit associ with backwoodsmen
who divid each sentenc into two equal part one part critic
grammat refin and choic of languag and the other part just such
an attempt to talk like a hunter or a mountain as a broadway clerk
might make after eat an edit of emerson bennett work and
studi frontier life at the boweri theatr a coupl of weeksi say
that the nausea which the goshoot gave me an indian worshipp set me
to examin author to see if perchanc i had been overestim
the red man while view him through the mellow moonshin of romanc
the revel that came were disench it was curious to see how
quick the paint and tinsel fell away from him and left him treacher
filthi and repulsiveand how quick the evid accumul that
wherev one find an indian tribe he has onli found goshoot more or
less modifi by circumst and surroundingsbut goshoot after all
they deserv piti poor creatur and they can have mineat this
distanc nearer by they never get anybodi

there is an impress abroad that the baltimor and washington railroad
compani and mani of it employe are goshoot but it is an error
there is onli a plausibl resembl which while it is apt enough to
mislead the ignor cannot deceiv parti who have contempl both
tribe but serious it was not onli poor wit but veri wrong to start
the report refer to abov for howev innoc the motiv may have
been the necessari effect was to injur the reput of a class who
have a hard enough time of it in the pitiless desert of the rocki
mountain heaven know if we cannot find it in our heart to give
those poor nake creatur our christian sympathi and compass in
god name let us at least not throw mud at them




chapter xx

on the seventeenth day we pass the highest mountain peak we had yet
seen and although the day was veri warm the night that follow upon it
heel was wintri cold and blanket were next to useless

on the eighteenth day we encount the eastwardbound
telegraphconstructor at rees river station and sent a messag to his
excel gov nye at carson citi distant one hundr and fiftysix
mile

on the nineteenth day we cross the great american desertforti
memor mile of bottomless sand into which the coach wheel sunk from
six inch to a foot we work our passag most of the way across
that is to say we got out and walk it was a dreari pull and a long
and thirsti one for we had no water from one extrem of this desert
to the other the road was white with the bone of oxen and hors
it would hard be an exagger to say that we could have walk the
forti mile and set our feet on a bone at everi step the desert was one
prodigi graveyard and the logchain wagon tyre and rot
wreck of vehicl were almost as thick as the bone i think we saw
logchain enough rust there in the desert to reach across ani state
in the union do not these relic suggest someth of an idea of the
fear suffer and privat the earli emigr to california
endur

at the border of the desert lie carson lake or the sink of the
carson a shallow melancholi sheet of water some eighti or a hundr
mile in circumfer carson river empti into it and is lostsink
mysteri into the earth and never appear in the light of the sun
againfor the lake has no outlet whatev

there are sever river in nevada and they all have this mysteri
fate they end in various lake or sink  and that is the last of
them carson lake humboldt lake walker lake mono lake are all great
sheet of water without ani visibl outlet water is alway flow into
them none is ever seen to flow out of them and yet they remain alway
level full neither reced nor overflow what they do with their
surplus is onli known to the creator

on the western verg of the desert we halt a moment at ragtown it
consist of one log hous and is not set down on the map

this remind me of a circumst just after we left julesburg on the
platt i was sit with the driver and he said

i can tell you a most laughabl thing inde if you would like to
listen to it horac greeley went over this road onc when he was
leav carson citi he told the driver hank monk that he had an
engag to lectur at placervill and was veri anxious to go through
quick hank monk crack his whip and start off at an aw pace
the coach bounc up and down in such a terrif way that it jolt the
button all off of horac coat and final shot his head clean through
the roof of the stage and then he yell at hank monk and beg him to
go easiersaid he warnt in as much of a hurri as he was awhil ago
but hank monk said keep your seat horac and ill get you there on
timeand you bet you he did too what was left of him 

a day or two after that we pick up a denver man at the cross road and
he told us a good deal about the countri and the gregori dig
he seem a veri entertain person and a man well post in the affair
of colorado by and by he remark

i can tell you a most laughabl thing inde if you would like to
listen to it horac greeley went over this road onc when he was
leav carson citi he told the driver hank monk that he had an

go easiersaid he warnt in as much of a hurri as he was awhil ago
but hank monk said keep your seat horac and ill get you there on
time and you bet you he did too what was left of him 

at fort bridger some day after this we took on board a cavalri
sergeant a veri proper and soldier person inde from no other man
dure the whole journey did we gather such a store of concis and
wellarrang militari inform it was surpris to find in the
desol wild of our countri a man so thorough acquaint with
everyth use to know in his line of life and yet of such inferior
rank and unpretenti bear for as much as three hour we listen
to him with unab interest final he got upon the subject of
transcontinent travel and present said

i can tell you a veri laughabl thing inde if you would like to
listen to it horac greeley went over this road onc when he was
leav carson citi he told the driver hank monk that he had an

but hank monk said keep your seat horac and ill get you there on
time and you bet you he did too what was left of him 

when we were eight hour out from salt lake citi a mormon preacher got in
with us at a way stationa gentl softspoken kind man and one whom
ani stranger would warm to at first sight i can never forget the patho
that was in his voic as he told in simpl languag the stori of his
peopl wander and unpiti suffer no pulpit eloqu was
ever so move and so beauti as this outcast pictur of the first
mormon pilgrimag across the plain struggl sorrow onward to the
land of it banish and mark it desol way with grave and
water it with tear his word so wrought upon us that it was a
relief to us all when the convers drift into a more cheer
channel and the natur featur of the curious countri we were in came
under treatment one matter after anoth was pleasant discuss and
at length the stranger said

i can tell you a most laughabl thing inde if you would like to
listen to it horac greeley went over this road onc when he was
leav carson citi he told the driver hank monk that he had an

but hank monk said keep your seat horac and ill get you there on

ten mile out of ragtown we found a poor wander who had lain down to
die he had walk as long as he could but his limb had fail him at
last hunger and fatigu had conquer him it would have been inhuman
to leav him there we paid his fare to carson and lift him into the
coach it was some littl time befor he show ani veri decid sign
of life but by dint of chafe him and pour brandi between his lip
we final brought him to a languid conscious then we fed him a
littl and by and by he seem to comprehend the situat and a
grate light soften his eye we made his mailsack bed as
comfort as possibl and construct a pillow for him with our coat
he seem veri thank then he look up in our face and said in a
feebl voic that had a trembl of honest emot in it

gentlemen i know not who you are but you have save my life and
although i can never be abl to repay you for it i feel that i can at
least make one hour of your long journey lighter i take it you are
stranger to this great thorough fare but i am entir familiar with
it in this connect i can tell you a most laughabl thing inde if
you would like to listen to it horac greeley

i said impress

suffer stranger proceed at your peril you see in me the melancholi
wreck of a onc stalwart and magnific manhood what has brought me to
this that thing which you are about to tell gradual but sure
that tiresom old anecdot has sap my strength undermin my
constitut wither my life piti my helpless spare me onli
just this onc and tell me about young georg washington and his littl
hatchet for a chang 

we were save but not so the invalid in tri to retain the anecdot
in his system he strain himself and die in our arm

i am awar now that i ought not to have ask of the sturdiest citizen
of all that region what i ask of that mere shadow of a man for after
seven year resid on the pacif coast i know that no passeng or
driver on the overland ever cork that anecdot in when a stranger was
by and surviv within a period of six year i cross and recross
the sierra between nevada and california thirteen time by stage and
listen to that deathless incid four hundr and eightyon or
eightytwo time i have the list somewher driver alway told it
conductor told it landlord told it chanc passeng told it the
veri chinamen and vagrant indian recount it i have had the same
driver tell it to me two or three time in the same afternoon it has
come to me in all the multitud of tongu that babel bequeath to
earth and flavor with whiskey brandi beer cologn sozodont
tobacco garlic onion grasshopperseveryth that has a fragranc to
it through all the long list of thing that are gorg or guzzl by the
son of men i never have smelt ani anecdot as often as i have smelt
that one never have smelt ani anecdot that smelt so varieg as that
one and you never could learn to know it by it smell becaus everi
time you thought you had learn the smell of it it would turn up with a
differ smell bayard taylor has written about this hoari anecdot
richardson has publish it so have jone smith johnson ross brown
and everi other correspondenceindit be that ever set his foot upon
the great overland road anywher between julesburg and san francisco and
i have heard that it is in the talmud i have seen it in print in nine
differ foreign languag i have been told that it is employ in the
inquisit in rome and i now learn with regret that it is go to be
set to music i do not think that such thing are right

stagecoach on the overland is no more and stage driver are a race
defunct i wonder if they bequeath that baldhead anecdot to their
successor the railroad brakemen and conductor and if these latter
still persecut the helpless passeng with it until he conclud as did
mani a tourist of other day that the real grandeur of the pacif
coast are not yo semit and the big tree but hank monk and his
adventur with horac greeley and what make that worn anecdot the
more aggrav is that the adventur it celebr never occur
if it were a good anecdot that seem demerit would be it chiefest
virtu for creativ power belong to great but what ought to be
done to a man who would wanton contriv so flat a one as this if i
were to suggest what ought to be done to him i should be call
extravagantbut what doe the sixteenth chapter of daniel say aha 




chapter xxi

we were approach the end of our long journey it was the morn of
the twentieth day at noon we would reach carson citi the capit of
nevada territori we were not glad but sorri it had been a fine
pleasur trip we had fed fat on wonder everi day we were now well
accustom to stage life and veri fond of it so the idea of come to a
standstil and settl down to a humdrum exist in a villag was not
agreeabl but on the contrari depress

visibl our new home was a desert wall in by barren snowclad
mountain there was not a tree in sight there was no veget but
the endless sagebrush and greasewood all natur was gray with it we
were plow through great deep of powderi alkali dust that rose in
thick cloud and float across the plain like smoke from a burn
hous

we were coat with it like miller so were the coach the mule the
mailbag the driverw and the sagebrush and the other sceneri were
all one monoton color long train of freight wagon in the distanc

otherwis we move in the midst of solitud silenc and desol
everi twenti step we pass the skeleton of some dead beast of burthen
with it dustcoat skin stretch tight over it empti rib
frequent a solemn raven sat upon the skull or the hip and contempl
the pass coach with medit seren

by and by carson citi was point out to us it nestl in the edg of a
great plain and was a suffici number of mile away to look like an
assemblag of mere white spot in the shadow of a grim rang of mountain
overlook it whose summit seem lift clear out of companionship
and conscious of earth thing

we arriv disembark and the stage went on it was a wooden town
it popul two thousand soul the main street consist of four or
five block of littl white frame store which were too high to sit down
on but not too high for various other purpos in fact hard high
enough they were pack close togeth side by side as if room were
scarc in that mighti plain

the sidewalk was of board that were more or less loos and inclin to
rattl when walk upon in the middl of the town opposit the store
was the plaza which is nativ to all town beyond the rocki mountain
a larg unfenc level vacanc with a liberti pole in it and veri
use as a place for public auction hors trade and mass meet
and likewis for teamster to camp in two other side of the plaza were
face by store offic and stabl

the rest of carson citi was pretti scatter

we were introduc to sever citizen at the stageoffic and on the
way up to the governor from the hotelamong other to a mr harri
who was on horseback he began to say someth but interrupt himself
with the remark

ill have to get you to excus me a minut yonder is the wit that
swore i help to rob the california coacha piec of impertin
intermeddl sir for i am not even acquaint with the man 

then he rode over and began to rebuk the stranger with a sixshoot
and the stranger began to explain with anoth when the pistol were
empti the stranger resum his work mend a whiplash and mr
harri rode by with a polit nod homeward bound with a bullet through
one of his lung and sever in his hip and from them issu littl
rivulet of blood that cours down the hors side and made the anim
look quit picturesqu i never saw harri shoot a man after that but it
recal to mind that first day in carson

this was all we saw that day for it was two oclock now and accord
to custom the daili washo zephyr set in a soar dustdrift about
the size of the unit state set up edgewis came with it and the
capit of nevada territori disappear from view

still there were sight to be seen which were not wholli uninterest
to new comer for the vast dust cloud was thick freckl with thing
strang to the upper airth live and dead that flit hither and
thither go and come appear and disappear among the roll
billow of dusthat chicken and parasol sail in the remot
heaven blanket tin sign sagebrush and shingl a shade lower
doormat and buffalo robe lower still shovel and coal scuttl on the
next grade glass door cat and littl children on the next disrupt
lumber yard light buggi and wheelbarrow on the next and down onli
thirti or forti feet abov ground was a scurri storm of emigr
roof and vacant lot

it was someth to see that much i could have seen more if i could
have kept the dust out of my eye

but serious a washo wind is by no mean a trifl matter it blow
flimsi hous down lift shingl roof occasion roll up tin one
like sheet music now and then blow a stage coach over and spill the
passeng and tradit say the reason there are so mani bald peopl
there is that the wind blow the hair off their head while they are
look skyward after their hat carson street seldom look inact on
summer afternoon becaus there are so mani citizen skip around
their escap hat like chambermaid tri to head off a spider

the washo zephyr washo is a pet nicknam for nevada is a peculiar
scriptur wind in that no man knoweth whenc it cometh  that is to
say where it origin it come right over the mountain from the
west but when one cross the ridg he doe not find ani of it on the
other side it probabl is manufactur on the mountaintop for the
occas and start from there it is a pretti regular wind in the
summer time it offic hour are from two in the afternoon till two the
next morn and anybodi ventur abroad dure those twelv hour
need to allow for the wind or he will bring up a mile or two to leeward
of the point he is aim at and yet the first complaint a washo
visitor to san francisco make is that the sea wind blow so there
there is a good deal of human natur in that

we found the state palac of the governor of nevada territori to consist
of a white frame onestori hous with two small room in it and a
stanchion support shed in frontfor grandeurit compel the respect
of the citizen and inspir the indian with awe the newli arriv
chief and associ justic of the territori and other machineri of the
govern were domicil with less splendor they were board around
privat and had their offic in their bedroom

the secretari and i took quarter in the ranch of a worthi french ladi
by the name of bridget oflannigan a camp follow of his excel the
governor she had known him in his prosper as commanderinchief of
the metropolitan polic of new york and she would not desert him in his
advers as governor of nevada

our room was on the lower floor face the plaza and when we had got
our bed a small tabl two chair the govern fireproof safe and
the unabridg dictionari into it there was still room enough left for a
visitormay be two but not without strain the wall but the wall
could stand itat least the partit could for they consist simpli
of one thick of white cotton domestic stretch from corner to
corner of the room this was the rule in carsonani other kind of
partit was the rare except and if you stood in a dark room and
your neighbor in the next had light the shadow on your canva told
queer secret sometim veri often these partit were made of old
flour sack bast togeth and then the differ between the common
herd and the aristocraci was that the common herd had unorna
sack while the wall of the aristocrat were overpow with
rudiment frescoi e red and blue mill brand on the flour sack

occasion also the better class embellish their canva by
past pictur from harper week on them in mani case too the
wealthi and the cultur rose to spittoon and other evid of a
sumptuous and luxuri tast washo peopl take a joke so hard that i
must explain that the abov descript was onli the rule there were
mani honor except in carsonplast ceil and hous that
had consider furnitur in them m t 

we had a carpet and a genuin queenswar washbowl consequ we
were hate without reserv by the other tenant of the oflannigan
ranch  when we ad a paint oilcloth window curtain we simpli took
our live into our own hand to prevent bloodsh i remov up stair
and took up quarter with the untitl plebeian in one of the fourteen
white pine cotbedstead that stood in two long rank in the one sole
room of which the second stori consist

it was a jolli compani the fourteen they were princip voluntari
campfollow of the governor who had join his retinu by their own
elect at new york and san francisco and came along feel that in
the scuffl for littl territori crumb and offic they could not make
their condit more precari than it was and might reason expect
to make it better they were popular known as the irish brigad 
though there were onli four or five irishmen among all the governor
retain

his goodnatur excel was much annoy at the gossip his henchmen
createdespeci when there aros a rumor that they were paid
assassin of his brought along to quiet reduc the democrat vote
when desir

mrs oflannigan was board and lodg them at ten dollar a week
apiec and they were cheer give their note for it they were
perfect satisfi but bridget present found that note that could
not be discount were but a feebl constitut for a carson
boardinghous so she began to harri the governor to find employ
for the brigad  her importun and their togeth drove him to a
gentl desper at last and he final summon the brigad to the
presenc then said he

gentlemen i have plan a lucrat and use servic for you
a servic which will provid you with recreat amid nobl landscap
and afford you never ceas opportun for enrich your mind by
observ and studi i want you to survey a railroad from carson citi
westward to a certain point when the legislatur meet i will have the
necessari bill pass and the remuner arrang 

what a railroad over the sierra nevada mountain 

well then survey it eastward to a certain point 

he convert them into surveyor chainbear and so on and turn
them loos in the desert it was recreation with a vengeanc
recreat on foot lug chain through sand and sagebrush under a
sultri sun and among cattl bone cayot and tarantula

romant adventure could go no further they survey veri slowli
veri deliber veri care they return everi night dure the
first week dusti footsor tire and hungri but veri jolli they
brought in great store of prodigi hairi spiderstarantulasand
imprison them in cover tumbler up stair in the ranch  after the
first week they had to camp on the field for they were get well
eastward they made a good mani inquiri as to the locat of that
indefinit certain point  but got no inform at last to a
peculiar urgent inquiri of how far eastward  governor nye
telegraph back

to the atlant ocean blast you and then bridg it and go on 

this brought back the dusti toiler who sent in a report and ceas from
their labor the governor was alway comfort about it he said mrs
oflannigan would hold him for the brigad board anyhow and he
intend to get what entertain he could out of the boy he said
with his oldtim pleasant twinkl that he meant to survey them into
utah and then telegraph brigham to hang them for trespass

the surveyor brought back more tarantula with them and so we had quit
a menageri arrang along the shelv of the room some of these
spider could straddl over a common saucer with their hairi muscular
leg and when their feel were hurt or their digniti offend they
were the wickedestlook desperado the anim world can furnish
if their glass prisonhous were touch ever so light they were up
and spoil for a fight in a minut starchi proud inde they
would take up a straw and pick their teeth like a member of congress
there was as usual a furious zephyr blow the first night of the
brigad return and about midnight the roof of an adjoin stabl blew
off and a corner of it came crash through the side of our ranch
there was a simultan awaken and a tumultu muster of the
brigad in the dark and a general tumbl and sprawl over each other
in the narrow aisl between the bedrow in the midst of the turmoil
bob h sprung up out of a sound sleep and knock down a shelf with
his head instant he shout

turn out boysth tarantula is loos 

no warn ever sound so dread nobodi tri ani longer to leav
the room lest he might step on a tarantula everi man grope for a
trunk or a bed and jump on it then follow the strangest silencea
silenc of grisli suspens it was toowait expect fear it
was as dark as pitch and one had to imagin the spectacl of those
fourteen scantclad men roost ginger on trunk and bed for not a
thing could be seen then came occasion littl interrupt of the
silenc and one could recogn a man and tell his local by his
voic or locat ani other sound a suffer made by his grope or
chang of posit the occasion voic were not given to much
speakingyou simpli heard a gentl ejacul of ow  follow by a
solid thump and you knew the gentleman had felt a hairi blanket or
someth touch his bare skin and had skip from a bed to the floor
anoth silenc present you would hear a gasp voic say

sususometh crawl up the back of my neck 

everi now and then you could hear a littl subdu scrambl and a
sorrow o lord  and then you knew that somebodi was get away from
someth he took for a tarantula and not lose ani time about it
either direct a voic in the corner rang out wild and clear

iv got him iv got him  paus and probabl chang of
circumst  no he got me oh aint they never go to fetch a
lantern 

the lantern came at that moment in the hand of mrs oflannigan whose
anxieti to know the amount of damag done by the assault roof had not
prevent her wait a judici interv after get out of bed and
light up to see if the wind was done now up stair or had a larger
contract

the landscap present when the lantern flash into the room was
picturesqu and might have been funni to some peopl but was not to us
although we were perch so strang upon box trunk and bed and so
strang attir too we were too earnest distress and too
genuin miser to see ani fun about it and there was not the
semblanc of a smile anywher visibl i know i am not capabl of
suffer more than i did dure those few minut of suspens in the
dark surround by those creep bloodymind tarantula i had
skip from bed to bed and from box to box in a cold agoni and everi
time i touch anyth that was furzi i fanci i felt the fang i had
rather go to war than live that episod over again nobodi was hurt
the man who thought a tarantula had got him was mistakenon a crack
in a box had caught his finger not one of those escap tarantula was
ever seen again there were ten or twelv of them we took candl and
hunt the place high and low for them but with no success did we go
back to bed then we did noth of the kind money could not have
persuad us to do it we sat up the rest of the night play cribbag
and keep a sharp lookout for the enemi




chapter xxii

it was the end of august and the sky were cloudless and the weather
superb in two or three week i had grown wonder fascin with
the curious new countri and conclud to put off my return to the
states awhil i had grown well accustom to wear a damag slouch
hat blue woolen shirt and pant cram into boottop and glori in
the absenc of coat vest and brace i felt rowdyish and bulli  as
the historian josephus phrase it in his fine chapter upon the
destruct of the templ it seem to me that noth could be so
fine and so romant i had becom an offic of the govern but
that was for mere sublim the offic was an uniqu sinecur i had
noth to do and no salari i was privat secretari to his majesti the
secretari and there was not yet write enough for two of us so johnni
k and i devot our time to amus he was the young son of an
ohio nabob and was out there for recreat he got it we had heard a
world of talk about the marvel beauti of lake taho and final
curios drove us thither to see it three or four member of the
brigad had been there and locat some timber land on it shore and
store up a quantiti of provis in their camp we strap a coupl
of blanket on our shoulder and took an axe apiec and startedfor we
intend to take up a wood ranch or so ourselv and becom wealthi
we were on foot the reader will find it advantag to go horseback
we were told that the distanc was eleven mile we tramp a long time
on level ground and then toil labori up a mountain about a
thousand mile high and look over no lake there we descend on the
other side cross the valley and toil up anoth mountain three or
four thousand mile high appar and look over again no lake
yet we sat down tire and perspir and hire a coupl of chinamen to
curs those peopl who had beguil us thus refresh we present
resum the march with renew vigor and determin we plod on
two or three hour longer and at last the lake burst upon usa nobl
sheet of blue water lift six thousand three hundr feet abov the
level of the sea and wall in by a rim of snowclad mountain peak that
tower aloft full three thousand feet higher still it was a vast oval
and one would have to use up eighti or a hundr good mile in travel
around it as it lay there with the shadow of the mountain brilliant
photograph upon it still surfac i thought it must sure be the
fairest pictur the whole earth afford

we found the small skiff belong to the brigad boy and without loss
of time set out across a deep bend of the lake toward the landmark that
signifi the local of the camp i got johnni to rownot becaus i
mind exert myself but becaus it make me sick to ride backward when
i am at work but i steer a threemil pull brought us to the camp
just as the night fell and we step ashor veri tire and wolfish
hungri in a cache among the rock we found the provis and the
cook utensil and then all fatigu as i was i sat down on a
boulder and superintend while johnni gather wood and cook supper
mani a man who had gone through what i had would have want to rest

it was a delici supperhot bread fri bacon and black coffe
it was a delici solitud we were in too three mile away was a
sawmil and some workmen but there were not fifteen other human be
throughout the wide circumfer of the lake as the dark close
down and the star came out and spangl the great mirror with jewel we
smoke medit in the solemn hush and forgot our troubl and our
pain in due time we spread our blanket in the warm sand between two
larg boulder and soon feel asleep careless of the process of ant
that pass in through rent in our cloth and explor our person
noth could disturb the sleep that fetter us for it had been fair
earn and if our conscienc had ani sin on them they had to adjourn
court for that night ani way the wind rose just as we were lose
conscious and we were lull to sleep by the beat of the surf
upon the shore

it is alway veri cold on that lake shore in the night but we had plenti
of blanket and were warm enough we never move a muscl all night but
wake at earli dawn in the origin posit and got up at onc
thorough refresh free from sore and brim full of friski
there is no end of wholesom medicin in such an experi that
morn we could have whip ten such peopl as we were the day befor
sick one at ani rate but the world is slow and peopl will go to
water cures and movement cures and to foreign land for health
three month of camp life on lake taho would restor an egyptian mummi
to his pristin vigor and give him an appetit like an allig i do
not mean the oldest and driest mummi of cours but the fresher one
the air up there in the cloud is veri pure and fine brace and
delici and whi shouldnt it be it is the same the angel breath
i think that hard ani amount of fatigu can be gather togeth that a
man cannot sleep off in one night on the sand by it side not under a
roof but under the sky it seldom or never rain there in the summer
time i know a man who went there to die but he made a failur of it
he was a skeleton when he came and could bare stand he had no
appetit and did noth but read tract and reflect on the futur
three month later he was sleep out of door regular eat all he
could hold three time a day and chase game over mountain three
thousand feet high for recreat and he was a skeleton no longer but
weigh part of a ton this is no fanci sketch but the truth his
diseas was consumpt i confid commend his experi to other
skeleton

i superintend again and as soon as we had eaten breakfast we got in
the boat and skirt along the lake shore about three mile and
disembark we like the appear of the place and so we claim
some three hundr acr of it and stuck our notices on a tree it was
yellow pine timber landa dens forest of tree a hundr feet high and
from one to five feet through at the butt it was necessari to fenc our
properti or we could not hold it that is to say it was necessari to
cut down tree here and there and make them fall in such a way as to form
a sort of enclosur with pretti wide gap in it we cut down three
tree apiec and found it such heartbreak work that we decid to
rest our case on those if they held the properti well and good if
they didnt let the properti spill out through the gap and go it was
no use to work ourselv to death mere to save a few acr of land
next day we came back to build a housefor a hous was also necessari
in order to hold the properti we decid to build a substanti
loghous and excit the envi of the brigad boy but by the time we had
cut and trim the first log it seem unnecessari to be so elabor
and so we conclud to build it of sapl howev two sapl duli
cut and trim compel recognit of the fact that a still modest
architectur would satisfi the law and so we conclud to build a
brush hous we devot the next day to this work but we did so much
sit around and discuss that by the middl of the afternoon we
had achiev onli a halfway sort of affair which one of us had to watch
while the other cut brush lest if both turn our back we might not be
abl to find it again it had such a strong famili resembl to the
surround veget but we were satisfi with it

we were land owner now duli seiz and possess and within the
protect of the law therefor we decid to take up our resid on
our own domain and enjoy that larg sens of independ which onli such
an experi can bring late the next afternoon after a good long
rest we sail away from the brigad camp with all the provis and
cook utensil we could carri offborrow is the more accur word
and just as the night was fall we beach the boat at our own land




chapter xxiii

if there is ani life that is happier than the life we led on our timber
ranch for the next two or three week it must be a sort of life which i
have not read of in book or experienc in person we did not see a
human be but ourselv dure the time or hear ani sound but those
that were made by the wind and the wave the sigh of the pine and
now and then the faroff thunder of an avalanch the forest about us
was dens and cool the sky abov us was cloudless and brilliant with
sunshin the broad lake befor us was glassi and clear or rippl and
breezi or black and stormtoss accord to natur mood and it
circl border of mountain dome cloth with forest scar with
landslid cloven by canon and valley and helmet with glitter
snow fit frame and finish the nobl pictur the view was alway
fascin bewitch entranc the eye was never tire of gaze
night or day in calm or storm it suffer but one grief and that was
that it could not look alway but must close sometim in sleep

we slept in the sand close to the water edg between two protect
boulder which took care of the stormi nightwind for us we never
took ani paregor to make us sleep at the first break of dawn we were
alway up and run footrac to tone down excess of physic vigor
and exuber of spirit that is johnni wasbut i held his hat
while smoke the pipe of peac after breakfast we watch the sentinel
peak put on the glori of the sun and follow the conquer light as
it swept down among the shadow and set the captiv crag and forest
free we watch the tint pictur grow and brighten upon the water
till everi littl detail of forest precipic and pinnacl was wrought in
and finish and the miracl of the enchant complet then to
busi 

that is drift around in the boat we were on the north shore
there the rock on the bottom are sometim gray sometim white
this give the marvel transpar of the water a fuller advantag
than it has elsewher on the lake we usual push out a hundr yard
or so from shore and then lay down on the thwart in the sun and let
the boat drift by the hour whither it would we seldom talk
it interrupt the sabbath still and mar the dream the luxuri
rest and indol brought the shore all along was indent with deep
curv bay and cove border by narrow sandbeach and where the
sand end the steep mountainsid rose right up aloft into spaceros
up like a vast wall a littl out of the perpendicular and thick wood
with tall pine

so singular clear was the water that where it was onli twenti or
thirti feet deep the bottom was so perfect distinct that the boat
seem float in the air yes where it was even eighti feet deep
everi littl pebbl was distinct everi speckl trout everi
handsbreadth of sand often as we lay on our face a granit
boulder as larg as a villag church would start out of the bottom
appar and seem climb up rapid to the surfac till present
it threaten to touch our face and we could not resist the impuls to
seiz an oar and avert the danger but the boat would float on and the
boulder descend again and then we could see that when we had been
exact abov it it must still have been twenti or thirti feet below the
surfac down through the transpar of these great depth the water
was not mere transpar but dazzl brilliant so all object
seen through it had a bright strong vivid not onli of outlin but
of everi minut detail which they would not have had when seen simpli
through the same depth of atmospher so empti and airi did all space
seem below us and so strong was the sens of float high aloft in
midnothing that we call these boatexcurs balloonvoyag 

we fish a good deal but we did not averag one fish a week we could
see trout by the thousand wing about in the empti under us or
sleep in shoal on the bottom but they would not bitethey could see
the line too plain perhap we frequent select the trout we
want and rest the bait patient and persist on the end of his
nose at a depth of eighti feet but he would onli shake it off with an
annoy manner and shift his posit

we bath occasion but the water was rather chilli for all it
look so sunni sometim we row out to the blue water  a mile or
two from shore it was as dead blue as indigo there becaus of the
immens depth by offici measur the lake in it centr is one
thousand five hundr and twentyf feet deep

sometim on lazi afternoon we loll on the sand in camp and smoke
pipe and read some old wellworn novel at night by the campfir we
play euchr and sevenup to strengthen the mindand play them with
card so greasi and defac that onli a whole summer acquaint with
them could enabl the student to tell the ace of club from the jack of
diamond

we never slept in our hous  it never recur to us for one thing
and besid it was built to hold the ground and that was enough we
did not wish to strain it

by and by our provis began to run short and we went back to the old
camp and laid in a new suppli we were gone all day and reach home
again about nightfal pretti tire and hungri while johnni was
carri the main bulk of the provis up to our house for futur
use i took the loaf of bread some slice of bacon and the coffeepot
ashor set them down by a tree lit a fire and went back to the boat to
get the fryingpan while i was at this i heard a shout from johnni
and look up i saw that my fire was gallop all over the premis
johnni was on the other side of it he had to run through the flame to
get to the lake shore and then we stood helpless and watch the
devast

the ground was deepli carpet with dri pineneedl and the fire
touch them off as if they were gunpowd it was wonder to see with
what fierc speed the tall sheet of flame travel my coffeepot was
gone and everyth with it in a minut and a half the fire seiz
upon a dens growth of dri manzanita chappar six or eight feet high
and then the roar and pop and crackl was someth terrif
we were driven to the boat by the intens heat and there we remain
spellbound

within half an hour all befor us was a toss blind tempest of
flame it went surg up adjac ridgessurmount them and
disappear in the canon beyondburst into view upon higher and farther
ridg presentlysh a grander illumin abroad and dove again
flame out again direct higher and still higher up the
mountainsidethrew out skirmish parti of fire here and there and
sent them trail their crimson spiral away among remot rampart and
rib and gorg till as far as the eye could reach the lofti
mountainfront were web as it were with a tangl network of red lava
stream away across the water the crag and dome were lit with a ruddi
glare and the firmament abov was a reflect hell

everi featur of the spectacl was repeat in the glow mirror of the
lake both pictur were sublim both were beauti but that in the
lake had a bewild rich about it that enchant the eye and held
it with the stronger fascin

we sat absorb and motionless through four long hour we never thought
of supper and never felt fatigu but at eleven oclock the
conflagr had travel beyond our rang of vision and then dark
stole down upon the landscap again

hunger assert itself now but there was noth to eat the provis
were all cook no doubt but we did not go to see we were homeless
wander again without ani properti our fenc was gone our hous
burn down no insur our pine forest was well scorch the dead
tree all burn up and our broad acr of manzanita swept away our
blanket were on our usual sandb howev and so we lay down and went
to sleep the next morn we start back to the old camp but while
out a long way from shore so great a storm came up that we dare not tri
to land so i bale out the sea we ship and johnni pull heavili
through the billow till we had reach a point three or four mile
beyond the camp the storm was increas and it becam evid that it
was better to take the hazard of beach the boat than go down in a
hundr fathom of water so we ran in with tall whitecap follow
and i sat down in the sternsheet and point her headon to the shore
the instant the bow struck a wave came over the stern that wash crew
and cargo ashor and save a deal of troubl we shiver in the lee of
a boulder all the rest of the day and froze all the night through in
the morn the tempest had gone down and we paddl down to the camp
without ani unnecessari delay we were so starv that we ate up the
rest of the brigad provis and then set out to carson to tell them
about it and ask their forgiv it was accord upon payment of
damag

chapter xxiv

i resolv to have a hors to ride i had never seen such wild free
magnific horsemanship outsid of a circus as these picturesquelyclad
mexican californian and mexican american display in carson
street everi day how they rode lean just gentl forward out of
the perpendicular easi and nonchal with broad slouchhat brim blown
squar up in front and long riata swing abov the head they swept
through the town like the wind the next minut they were onli a sail
puff of dust on the far desert if they trot they sat up gallant
and grace and seem part of the hors did not go jigger up and
down after the silli missnanc fashion of the ridingschool i had
quick learn to tell a hors from a cow and was full of anxieti to
learn more i was resolv to buy a hors

while the thought was rankl in my mind the auction came skurri
through the plaza on a black beast that had as mani hump and corner on
him as a dromedari and was necessarili uncom but he was go
go at twentytwo hors saddl and bridl at twentytwo dollar
gentlemen  and i could hard resist

a man whom i did not know he turn out to be the auction brother
notic the wist look in my eye and observ that that was a veri
remark hors to be go at such a price and ad that the saddl
alon was worth the money it was a spanish saddl with ponder
tapidaro and furnish with the ungain soleleath cover with
the unspel name i said i had half a notion to bid then this
keeney person appear to me to be take my measure but i
dismiss the suspicion when he spoke for his manner was full of
guileless candor and truth said he

i know that horseknow him well you are a stranger i take it and so
you might think he was an american hors mayb but i assur you he is
not he is noth of the kind butexcus my speak in a low voic
other peopl be nearh is without the shadow of a doubt a genuin
mexican plug 

i did not know what a genuin mexican plug was but there was someth
about this man way of say it that made me swear inward that i
would own a genuin mexican plug or die

has he ani othereradvantag  i inquir suppress what
eager i could

he hook his forefing in the pocket of my armyshirt led me to one
side and breath in my ear impress these word

he can outbuck anyth in america 

go go goingat twenttyfour dollar and a half gen

twentyseven  i shout in a frenzi

and sold  said the auction and pass over the genuin mexican plug
to me

i could scarc contain my exult i paid the money and put the
anim in a neighbor liveryst to dine and rest himself

in the afternoon i brought the creatur into the plaza and certain
citizen held him by the head and other by the tail while i mount
him as soon as they let go he place all his feet in a bunch togeth
lower his back and then sudden arch it upward and shot me
straight into the air a matter of three or four feet i came as straight
down again lit in the saddl went instant up again came down almost
on the high pommel shot up again and came down on the hors neckal
in the space of three or four second then he rose and stood almost
straight up on his hind feet and i clasp his lean neck desper
slid back into the saddl and held on he came down and immedi
hoist his heel into the air deliv a vicious kick at the sky and
stood on his forefeet and then down he came onc more and began the
origin exercis of shoot me straight up again the third time i
went up i heard a stranger say

oh dont he buck though 

while i was up somebodi struck the hors a sound thwack with a
leathern strap and when i arriv again the genuin mexican plug was not
there a california youth chase him up and caught him and ask if he
might have a ride i grant him that luxuri he mount the genuin
got lift into the air onc but sent his spur home as he descend
and the hors dart away like a telegram he soar over three fenc
like a bird and disappear down the road toward the washo valley

i sat down on a stone with a sigh and by a natur impuls one of my
hand sought my forehead and the other the base of my stomach i
believ i never appreci till then the poverti of the human
machineryfor i still need a hand or two to place elsewher pen
cannot describ how i was jolt up imagin cannot conceiv how
disjoint i washow intern extern and univers i was
unsettl mix up and ruptur there was a sympathet crowd around
me though

one elderlylook comfort said

stranger youv been taken in everybodi in this camp know that
hors ani child ani injun could have told you that hed buck he is
the veri worst devil to buck on the contin of america you hear me
im curri old curri old abe curri and moreov he is a simonpur
outandout genuin dd mexican plug and an uncommon mean one at that
too whi you turnip if you had laid low and kept dark there chanc
to buy an american hors for mighti littl more than you paid for that
bloodi old foreign relic 

i gave no sign but i made up my mind that if the auction brother
funer took place while i was in the territori i would postpon all
other recreat and attend it

after a gallop of sixteen mile the californian youth and the genuin
mexican plug came tear into town again shed foamflak like the
spumespray that drive befor a typhoon and with one final skip over a
wheelbarrow and a chinaman cast anchor in front of the ranch 

such pant and blow such spread and contract of the red
equin nostril and glare of the wild equin eye but was the
imperi beast subjug inde he was not

his lordship the speaker of the hous thought he was and mount him to
go down to the capitol but the first dash the creatur made was over a
pile of telegraph pole half as high as a church and his time to the
capitolon mile and three quartersremain unbeaten to this day but
then he took an advantageh left out the mile and onli did the three
quarter that is to say he made a straight cut across lot prefer
fenc and ditch to a crook road and when the speaker got to the
capitol he said he had been in the air so much he felt as if he had made
the trip on a comet

in the even the speaker came home afoot for exercis and got the
genuin tow back behind a quartz wagon the next day i loan the
anim to the clerk of the hous to go down to the dana silver mine six
mile and he walk back for exercis and got the hors tow
everybodi i loan him to alway walk back they never could get enough
exercis ani other way

still i continu to loan him to anybodi who was will to borrow him
my idea be to get him crippl and throw him on the borrow hand
or kill and make the borrow pay for him but somehow noth ever
happen to him he took chanc that no other hors ever took and
surviv but he alway came out safe it was his daili habit to tri
experi that had alway befor been consid imposs but he
alway got through sometim he miscalcul a littl and did not get
his rider through intact but he alway got through himself of cours i
had tri to sell him but that was a stretch of simplic which met
with littl sympathi the auction storm up and down the street on
him for four day dispers the populac interrupt busi and
destroy children and never got a bidat least never ani but the
eighteendollar one he hire a notori substanceless bummer to make
the peopl onli smile pleasant and restrain their desir to buy if
they had ani then the auction brought in his bill and i withdrew
the hors from the market we tri to trade him off at privat vendu
next offer him at a sacrific for secondhand tombston old iron
temper tractsani kind of properti but holder were stiff and we
retir from the market again i never tri to ride the hors ani more
walk was good enough exercis for a man like me that had noth the
matter with him except ruptur intern injuri and such thing
final i tri to give him away but it was a failur parti said
earthquak were handi enough on the pacif coastthey did not wish to
own one as a last resort i offer him to the governor for the use of
the brigad  his face lit up eager at first but tone down again
and he said the thing would be too palpabl

just then the liveri stabl man brought in his bill for six week
keepingstallroom for the hors fifteen dollar hay for the hors
two hundr and fifti the genuin mexican plug had eaten a ton of the
articl and the man said he would have eaten a hundr if he had let
him

i will remark here in all serious that the regular price of hay
dure that year and a part of the next was realli two hundr and fifti
dollar a ton dure a part of the previous year it had sold at five
hundr a ton in gold and dure the winter befor that there was such
scarciti of the articl that in sever instanc small quantiti had
brought eight hundr dollar a ton in coin the consequ might be
guess without my tell it peopl turn their stock loos to
starv and befor the spring arriv carson and eagl valley were
almost liter carpet with their carcas ani old settler there
will verifi these statement

i manag to pay the liveri bill and that same day i gave the genuin
mexican plug to a pass arkansa emigr whom fortun deliv into
my hand if this ever meet his eye he will doubtless rememb the
donat

now whoever has had the luck to ride a real mexican plug will recogn
the anim depict in this chapter and hard consid him exagger
but the uniniti will feel justifi in regard his portrait as a
fanci sketch perhap




chapter xxv

origin nevada was a part of utah and was call carson counti and a
pretti larg counti it was too certain of it valley produc no end
of hay and this attract small coloni of mormon stockrais and
farmer to them a few orthodox american straggl in from california
but no love was lost between the two class of colonist there was
littl or no friend intercours each parti staid to itself the
mormon were larg in the major and had the addit advantag of
be peculiar under the protect of the mormon govern of the
territori therefor they could afford to be distant and even
peremptori toward their neighbor one of the tradit of carson
valley illustr the condit of thing that prevail at the time i
speak of the hire girl of one of the american famili was irish and
a cathol yet it was note with surpris that she was the onli person
outsid of the mormon ring who could get favor from the mormon she
ask kind of them often and alway got them it was a mysteri to
everybodi but one day as she was pass out at the door a larg bowi
knife drop from under her apron and when her mistress ask for an
explan she observ that she was go out to borri a washtub from
the mormon 

in  silver lode were discov in carson counti  and then the
aspect of thing chang californian began to flock in and the
american element was soon in the major allegi to brigham young
and utah was renounc and a temporari territori govern for
washoe was institut by the citizen governor roop was the first and
onli chief magistr of it in due cours of time congress pass a
bill to organ nevada territori  and presid lincoln sent out
governor nye to supplant roop

at this time the popul of the territori was about twelv or fifteen
thousand and rapid increas silver mine were be vigor
develop and silver mill erect busi of all kind was activ and
prosper and grow more so day by day

the peopl were glad to have a legitim constitut govern but
did not particular enjoy have stranger from distant state put in
author over thema sentiment that was natur enough they thought
the offici should have been chosen from among themselv from among
promin citizen who had earn a right to such promot and who
would be in sympathi with the populac and likewis thorough acquaint
with the need of the territori they were right in view the matter
thus without doubt the new offic were emigr  and that was no
titl to anybodi affect or admir either

the new govern was receiv with consider cool it was not
onli a foreign intrud but a poor one it was not even worth pluck
except by the smallest of small fri officeseek and such everybodi
knew that congress had appropri onli twenti thousand dollar a year
in greenback for it supportabout money enough to run a quartz mill a
month and everybodi knew also that the first year money was still
in washington and that the get hold of it would be a tedious and
difficult process carson citi was too wari and too wise to open up a
credit account with the import bantl with anyth like indec
hast

there is someth solemn funni about the struggl of a newborn
territori govern to get a start in this world our had a tri
time of it the organ act and the instructions from the state
depart command that a legislatur should be elect at
suchandsuch a time and it sit inaugur at suchandsuch a
date it was easi to get legisl even at three dollar a day
although board was four dollar and fifti cent for distinct has it
charm in nevada as well as elsewher and there were plenti of patriot
soul out of employ but to get a legisl hall for them to meet
in was anoth matter altogeth carson bland declin to give a room
rentfre or let one to the govern on credit

but when curri heard of the difficulti he came forward solitari and
alon and shoulder the ship of state over the bar and got her afloat
again i refer to curryold curryold abe curri  but for him the
legislatur would have been oblig to sit in the desert he offer his
larg stone build just outsid the capit limit rentfre and it
was glad accept then he built a horserailroad from town to the
capitol and carri the legisl grati

he also furnish pine bench and chair for the legislatur and
cover the floor with clean sawdust by way of carpet and spittoon
combin but for curri the govern would have die in it tender
infanc a canva partit to separ the senat from the hous of
repres was put up by the secretari at a cost of three dollar
and forti cent but the unit state declin to pay for it upon
be remind that the instructions permit the payment of a liber
rent for a legisl hall and that that money was save to the countri
by mr curri generos the unit state said that did not alter the
matter and the three dollar and forti cent would be subtract from
the secretari eighteen hundr dollar salaryand it was

the matter of print was from the begin an interest featur of
the new govern difficulti the secretari was sworn to obey his
volum of written instruct  and these command him to do two
certain thing without fail viz

 get the hous and senat journal print and
 for this work pay one dollar and fifti cent per thousand for
composit and one dollar and fifti cent per token for presswork
in greenback

it was easi to swear to do these two thing but it was entir
imposs to do more than one of them when greenback had gone down to
forti cent on the dollar the price regular charg everybodi by
print establish were one dollar and fifti cent per thousand
and one dollar and fifti cent per token  in gold the instructions
command that the secretari regard a paper dollar issu by the
govern as equal to ani other dollar issu by the govern henc
the print of the journal was discontinu then the unit state
stern rebuk the secretari for disregard the instruct  and
warn him to correct his way wherefor he got some print done
forward the bill to washington with full exhibit of the high price of
thing in the territori and call attent to a print market report
wherein it would be observ that even hay was two hundr and fifti
dollar a ton the unit state respond by subtract the
printingbil from the secretari suffer salaryand moreov
remark with dens graviti that he would find noth in his
instructions requir him to purchas hay

noth in this world is pall in such impenetr obscur as a u s
treasuri comptrol understand the veri fire of the hereaft
could get up noth more than a fit glimmer in it in the day i
speak of he never could be made to comprehend whi it was that twenti
thousand dollar would not go as far in nevada where all commod
rang at an enorm figur as it would in the other territori where
exceed cheap was the rule he was an offic who look out for
the littl expens all the time the secretari of the territori kept
his offic in his bedroom as i befor remark and he charg the
unit state no rent although his instructions provid for that item
and he could have just taken advantag of it a thing which i would
have done with more than lightn prompt if i had been secretari
myself but the unit state never applaud this devot inde i
think my countri was asham to have so improvid a person in it
employ

those instructions we use to read a chapter from them everi morn
as intellectu gymnast and a coupl of chapter in sunday school
everi sabbath for they treat of all subject under the sun and had
much valuabl religi matter in them along with the other statist
those instructions command that penkniv envelop pen and
writingpap be furnish the member of the legislatur so the
secretari made the purchas and the distribut the knive cost three
dollar apiec there was one too mani and the secretari gave it to the
clerk of the hous of repres the unit state said the clerk
of the hous was not a member of the legislatur and took that three
dollar out of the secretari salari as usual

white men charg three or four dollar a load for saw up
stovewood the secretari was sagaci enough to know that the unit
state would never pay ani such price as that so he got an indian to saw
up a load of offic wood at one dollar and a half he made out the usual
voucher but sign no name to itsimpli append a note explain that
an indian had done the work and had done it in a veri capabl and
satisfactori way but could not sign the voucher owe to lack of abil
in the necessari direct the secretari had to pay that dollar and a
half he thought the unit state would admir both his economi and his
honesti in get the work done at half price and not put a
pretend indian signatur to the voucher but the unit state did
not see it in that light

the unit state was too much accustom to employ dollarandahalf
thiev in all manner of offici capac to regard his explan of
the voucher as have ani foundat in fact

but the next time the indian saw wood for us i taught him to make a
cross at the bottom of the voucherit look like a cross that had been
drunk a yearand then i witnessed it and it went through all right
the unit state never said a word i was sorri i had not made the
voucher for a thousand load of wood instead of one

the govern of my countri snub honest simplic but fondl artist
villaini and i think i might have develop into a veri capabl
pickpocket if i had remain in the public servic a year or two

that was a fine collect of sovereign that first nevada legislatur
they levi tax to the amount of thirti or forti thousand dollar and
order expenditur to the extent of about a million yet they had
their littl period explos of economi like all other bodi of
the kind a member propos to save three dollar a day to the nation by
dispens with the chaplain and yet that shortsight man need the
chaplain more than ani other member perhap for he general sat with
his feet on his desk eat raw turnip dure the morn prayer

the legislatur sat sixti day and pass privat tollroad franchis
all the time when they adjourn it was estim that everi citizen
own about three franchis and it was believ that unless congress
gave the territori anoth degre of longitud there would not be room
enough to accommod the tollroad the end of them were hang over
the boundari line everywher like a fring

the fact is the freight busi had grown to such import
proport that there was near as much excit over sudden
acquir tollroad fortun as over the wonder silver mine




chapter xxvi

by and by i was smitten with the silver fever prospect parties
were leav for the mountain everi day and discov and take
possess of rich silverbear lode and ledg of quartz plain
this was the road to fortun the great gould and curry mine was held
at three or four hundr dollar a foot when we arriv but in two
month it had sprung up to eight hundr the ophir had been worth
onli a mere trifl a year gone by and now it was sell at near four
thousand dollar a foot not a mine could be name that had not
experienc an astonish advanc in valu within a short time
everybodi was talk about these marvel go where you would you heard
noth els from morn till far into the night tom soandso had
sold out of the amanda smith for  hadnt a cent when he took
up the ledg six month ago john jone had sold half his interest in
the bald eagl and mari ann for   gold coin and gone to the
state for his famili the widow brewster had struck it rich in the
golden fleece and sold ten feet for  hadnt money enough to buy
a crape bonnet when sings tommi kill her husband at baldi johnson
wake last spring the last chance had found a clay casing and knew
they were right on the ledgeconsequ feet that went beg
yesterday were worth a brick hous apiec today and seedi owner who
could not get trust for a drink at ani bar in the countri yesterday
were roar drunk on champagn today and had host of warm person
friend in a town where they had forgotten how to bow or shake hand from
longcontinu want of practic johnni morgan a common loafer had
gone to sleep in the gutter and wake up worth a hundr thousand
dollar in consequ of the decis in the ladi franklin and rough
and ready lawsuit and so onday in and day out the talk pelt our
ear and the excit wax hotter and hotter around us

i would have been more or less than human if i had not gone mad like the
rest cartload of solid silver brick as larg as pig of lead were
arriv from the mill everi day and such sight as that gave substanc
to the wild talk about me i succumb and grew as frenzi as the
craziest

everi few day news would come of the discoveri of a brannew mine
region immedi the paper would teem with account of it rich
and away the surplus popul would scamper to take possess by the
time i was fair inocul with the diseas esmeralda had just had a
run and humboldt was begin to shriek for attent humboldt
humboldt  was the new cri and straightway humboldt the newest of the
new the richest of the rich the most marvel of the marvel
discoveri in silverland was occupi two column of the public print
to esmeraldas one i was just on the point of start to esmeralda
but turn with the tide and got readi for humboldt that the reader may
see what move me and what would as sure have move him had he been
there i insert here one of the newspap letter of the day it and
sever other letter from the same calm hand were the main mean of
convert me i shall not garbl the extract but put it in just as it
appear in the daili territori enterpris

but what about our mine i shall be candid with you i shall
express an honest opinion base upon a thorough examin
humboldt counti is the richest miner region upon god footstool
each mountain rang is gorg with the precious ore humboldt is
the true golconda

the other day an assay of mere crop yield exceed four
thousand dollar to the ton a week or two ago an assay of just
such surfac develop made return of seven thousand dollar to
the ton our mountain are full of rambl prospector each day
and almost everi hour reveal new and more startl evid of
the profus and intensifi wealth of our favor counti the metal
is not silver alon there are distinct ledg of aurifer ore
a late discoveri plain evinc cinnabar the coarser metal are
in gross abund late evid of bitumin coal have been
detect my theori has ever been that coal is a ligneous
format i told col whitman in time past that the
neighborhood of dayton nevada betray no present or previous
manifest of a ligneous foundat and that henc i had no
confid in his laud coal mine i repeat the same doctrin
to the exult coal discover of humboldt i talk with my
friend captain burch on the subject my pyrhan vanish upon his
statement that in the veri region refer to he had seen petrifi
tree of the length of two hundr feet then is the fact
establish that huge forest onc cast their grim shadow over this
remot section i am firm in the coal faith

have no fear of the miner resourc of humboldt counti they are
immenseincalcul

let me state one or two thing which will help the reader to better
comprehend certain item in the abov at this time our near neighbor
gold hill was the most success silver mine local in nevada it
was from there that more than half the daili shipment of silver brick
came veri rich and scarc gold hill ore yield from  to 
to the ton but the usual yield was onli  to  per tonthat is to
say each hundr pound of ore yield from one dollar to two dollar
but the reader will perceiv by the abov extract that in humboldt from
one fourth to near half the mass was silver that is to say everi one
hundr pound of the ore had from two hundr dollar up to about three
hundr and fifti in it some day later this same correspond wrote

i have spoken of the vast and almost fabul wealth of this
regionit is incred the intestin of our mountain are
gorg with precious ore to plethora i have said that natur
has so shape our mountain as to furnish most excel
facil for the work of our mine i have also told you
that the countri about here is pregnant with the finest mill
site in the world but what is the mine histori of humboldt
the sheba mine is in the hand of energet san francisco
capitalist it would seem that the ore is combin with metal
that render it difficult of reduct with our imperfect mountain
machineri the proprietor have combin the capit and labor
hint at in my exordium they are toil and probe their
tunnel has reach the length of one hundr feet from primal
assay alon coupl with the develop of the mine and public
confid in the continu of effort the stock had rear
itself to eight hundr dollar market valu i do not know that
one ton of the ore has been convert into current metal i do
know that there are mani lode in this section that surpass the
sheba in primal assay valu listen a moment to the calcul
of the sheba oper they purpos transport the ore
concentr to europ the convey from star citi it
local to virginia citi will cost seventi dollar per ton
from virginia to san francisco forti dollar per ton from
thenc to liverpool it destin ten dollar per ton their
idea is that it conglomer metal will reimburs them their
cost of origin extract the price of transport and the
expens of reduct and that then a ton of the raw ore will net
them twelv hundr dollar the estim may be extravag
cut it in twain and the product is enorm far transcend
ani previous develop of our raci territori

a veri common calcul is that mani of our mine will yield
five hundr dollar to the ton such fecund throw the gould
 curri the ophir and the mexican of your neighborhood in the
darkest shadow i have given you the estim of the valu of a
singl develop mine it rich is index by it market
valuat the peopl of humboldt counti are feet crazi as i
write our town are near desert they look as languid as a
consumpt girl what has becom of our sinewi and athlet
fellowcitizen they are cours through ravin and over
mountain top their track are visibl in everi direct
occasion a horseman will dash among us his steed betray
hard usag he alight befor his adob dwell hastili
exchang courtesi with his townsmen hurri to an assay
offic and from thenc to the district record in the
morn have renew his provision suppli he is off again
on his wild and unbeaten rout whi the fellow number alreadi
his feet by the thousand he is the horseleech he has the
crave stomach of the shark or anaconda he would conquer
metal world

this was enough the instant we had finish read the abov articl
four of us decid to go to humboldt we commenc get readi at
onc and we also commenc upbraid ourselv for not decid
soonerfor we were in terror lest all the rich mine would be found and
secur befor we got there and we might have to put up with ledg that
would not yield more than two or three hundr dollar a ton mayb an
hour befor i would have felt opul if i had own ten feet in a gold
hill mine whose ore produc twentyf dollar to the ton now i was
alreadi annoy at the prospect of have to put up with mine the
poorest of which would be a marvel in gold hill




chapter xxvii

hurri was the word we wast no time our parti consist of four
personsa blacksmith sixti year of age two young lawyer and myself
we bought a wagon and two miser old hors we put eighteen hundr
pound of provis and mine tool in the wagon and drove out of
carson on a chilli decemb afternoon the hors were so weak and old
that we soon found that it would be better if one or two of us got out
and walk it was an improv next we found that it would be
better if a third man got out that was an improv also it was at
this time that i volunt to drive although i had never driven a
har hors befor and mani a man in such a posit would have felt
fair excus from such a respons but in a littl while it was
found that it would be a fine thing if the drive got out and walk also
it was at this time that i resign the posit of driver and never
resum it again within the hour we found that it would not onli be
better but was absolut necessari that we four take turn two at
a time should put our hand against the end of the wagon and push it
through the sand leav the feebl hors littl to do but keep out of
the way and hold up the tongu perhap it is well for one to know his
fate at first and get reconcil to it we had learn our in one
afternoon it was plain that we had to walk through the sand and shove
that wagon and those hors two hundr mile so we accept the
situat and from that time forth we never rode more than that we
stood regular and near constant watch push up behind

we made seven mile and camp in the desert young clagett now member
of congress from montana unhar and fed and water the hors
oliph and i cut sagebrush built the fire and brought water to cook
with and old mr ballou the blacksmith did the cook this divis
of labor and this appoint was adher to throughout the journey
we had no tent and so we slept under our blanket in the open plain we
were so tire that we slept sound

we were fifteen day make the triptwo hundr mile thirteen
rather for we lay by a coupl of day in one place to let the hors
rest

we could realli have accomplish the journey in ten day if we had tow
the hors behind the wagon but we did not think of that until it was
too late and so went on shove the hors and the wagon too when we
might have save half the labor parti who met us occasion
advis us to put the hors in the wagon but mr ballou through whose
ironclad earnest no sarcasm could pierc said that that would not
do becaus the provis were expos and would suffer the hors
be bitumin from long depriv  the reader will excus me from
translat what mr ballou customarili meant when he use a long
word was a secret between himself and his maker he was one of the best
and kindest heart men that ever grace a humbl sphere of life he was
gentl and simplic itselfand unselfish too although he
was more than twice as old as the eldest of us he never gave himself ani
air privileg or exempt on that account he did a young man
share of the work and did his share of convers and entertain from
the general standpoint of ani agenot from the arrog overaw
summitheight of sixti year his one strike peculiar was his
partingtonian fashion of love and use big word for their own sake
and independ of ani bear they might have upon the thought he was
purpos to convey he alway let his ponder syllabl fall with an
easi unconsci that left them wholli without offens
in truth his air was so natur and so simpl that one was alway
catch himself accept his state sentenc as mean someth
when they realli meant noth in the world if a word was long and
grand and reson that was suffici to win the old man love and he
would drop that word into the most outoftheway place in a sentenc or
a subject and be as pleas with it as if it were perfect lumin
with mean

we four alway spread our common stock of blanket togeth on the frozen
ground and slept side by side and find that our foolish longleg
hound pup had a deal of anim heat in him oliph got to admit him
to the bed between himself and mr ballou hug the dog warm back
to his breast and find great comfort in it but in the night the pup
would get stretchi and brace his feet against the old man back and
shove grunt complac the while and now and then be warm and
snug grate and happi he would paw the old man back simpli in
excess of comfort and at yet other time he would dream of the chase and
in his sleep tug at the old man back hair and bark in his ear the old
gentleman complain mild about these familiar at last and when
he got through with his statement he said that such a dog as that was not
a proper anim to admit to bed with tire men becaus he was so
meretrici in his movement and so organ in his emot  we turn
the dog out

it was a hard wear toilsom journey but it had it bright side for
after each day was done and our wolfish hunger appeas with a hot supper
of fri bacon bread molass and black coffe the pipesmok
songsing and yarnspin around the even campfir in the still
solitud of the desert was a happi carefre sort of recreat that
seem the veri summit and culmin of earth luxuri

it is a kind of life that has a potent charm for all men whether citi or
countrybr we are descend from desertloung arab and countless
age of growth toward perfect civil have fail to root out of us
the nomad instinct we all confess to a gratifi thrill at the
thought of camp out 

onc we made twentyf mile in a day and onc we made forti mile
through the great american desert and ten mile beyondfifti in all
in twentythre hour without halt to eat drink or rest to stretch
out and go to sleep even on stoni and frozen ground after push a
wagon and two hors fifti mile is a delight so suprem that for the
moment it almost seem cheap at the price

we camp two day in the neighborhood of the sink of the humboldt 
we tri to use the strong alkalin water of the sink but it would not
answer it was like drink lye and not weak lye either it left a
tast in the mouth bitter and everi way execr and a burn in the
stomach that was veri uncomfort we put molass in it but that
help it veri littl we ad a pickl yet the alkali was the
promin tast and so it was unfit for drink

the coffe we made of this water was the meanest compound man has yet
invent it was realli viler to the tast than the unamelior water
itself mr ballou be the architect and builder of the beverag felt
constrain to endors and uphold it and so drank half a cup by littl
sip make shift to prais it faint the while but final threw out
the remaind and said frank it was too technic for him 

but present we found a spring of fresh water conveni and then
with noth to mar our enjoy and no straggler to interrupt it we
enter into our rest




chapter xxviii

after leav the sink we travel along the humboldt river a littl
way peopl accustom to the monster milewid mississippi grow
accustom to associ the term river with a high degre of wateri
grandeur consequ such peopl feel rather disappoint when they
stand on the shore of the humboldt or the carson and find that a river
in nevada is a sick rivulet which is just the counterpart of the eri
canal in all respect save that the canal is twice as long and four time
as deep one of the pleasantest and most invigor exercis one can
contriv is to run and jump across the humboldt river till he is
overh and then drink it dri

on the fifteenth day we complet our march of two hundr mile and
enter unionvill humboldt counti in the midst of a drive
snowstorm unionvill consist of eleven cabin and a libertypol
six of the cabin were strung along one side of a deep canyon and the
other five face them the rest of the landscap was made up of bleak
mountain wall that rose so high into the sky from both side of the
canyon that the villag was left as it were far down in the bottom of a
crevic it was alway daylight on the mountain top a long time befor
the dark lift and reveal unionvill

we built a small rude cabin in the side of the crevic and roof it
with canva leav a corner open to serv as a chimney through which
the cattl use to tumbl occasion at night and mash our furnitur
and interrupt our sleep it was veri cold weather and fuel was scarc
indian brought brush and bush sever mile on their back and when
we could catch a laden indian it was welland when we could not which
was the rule not the except we shiver and bore it

i confess without shame that i expect to find mass of silver lie
all about the ground i expect to see it glitter in the sun on the
mountain summit i said noth about this for some instinct told me
that i might possibl have an exagger idea about it and so if i
betray my thought i might bring deris upon myself yet i was as
perfect satisfi in my own mind as i could be of anyth that i was
go to gather up in a day or two or at furthest a week or two silver
enough to make me satisfactorili wealthyand so my fanci was alreadi
busi with plan for spend this money the first opportun that
offer i saunter careless away from the cabin keep an eye on
the other boy and stop and contempl the sky when they seem
to be observ me but as soon as the coast was manifest clear i fled
away as guiltili as a thief might have done and never halt till i was
far beyond sight and call then i began my search with a feverish
excit that was brim of expectationalmost of certainti
i crawl about the ground seiz and examin bit of stone blow
the dust from them or rub them on my cloth and then peer at
them with anxious hope present i found a bright fragment and my heart
bound i hid behind a boulder and polish it and scrutin it with
a nervous eager and a delight that was more pronounc than absolut
certainti itself could have afford the more i examin the fragment
the more i was convinc that i had found the door to fortun i mark
the spot and carri away my specimen up and down the rug mountain
side i search with alway increas interest and alway augment
gratitud that i had come to humboldt and come in time of all the
experi of my life this secret search among the hidden treasur of
silverland was the nearest to unmar ecstasi it was a deliri
revel

by and by in the bed of a shallow rivulet i found a deposit of shine
yellow scale and my breath almost forsook me a gold mine and in my
simplic i had been content with vulgar silver i was so excit that
i half believ my overwrought imagin was deceiv me then a fear
came upon me that peopl might be observ me and would guess my secret
move by this thought i made a circuit of the place and ascend a
knoll to reconnoit solitud no creatur was near then i return
to my mine fortifi myself against possibl disappoint but my
fear were groundlessth shine scale were still there i set about
scoop them out and for an hour i toil down the wind of the
stream and rob it bed but at last the descend sun warn me to
give up the quest and i turn homeward laden with wealth as i walk
along i could not help smile at the thought of my be so excit over
my fragment of silver when a nobler metal was almost under my nose in
this littl time the former had so fallen in my estim that onc or
twice i was on the point of throw it away

the boy were as hungri as usual but i could eat noth neither could
i talk i was full of dream and far away their convers
interrupt the flow of my fanci somewhat and annoy me a littl too
i despis the sordid and commonplac thing they talk about but as
they proceed it began to amus me it grew to be rare fun to hear
them plan their poor littl economi and sigh over possibl
privat and distress when a gold mine all our own lay within sight
of the cabin and i could point it out at ani moment smother hilar
began to oppress me present it was hard to resist the impuls to
burst out with exult and reveal everyth but i did resist i
said within myself that i would filter the great news through my lip
calm and be seren as a summer morn while i watch it effect in
their face i said

where have you all been 

prospect 

what did you find 

noth 

noth what do you think of the countri 

cant tell yet  said mr ballou who was an old gold miner and had
likewis had consider experi among the silver mine

well havent you form ani sort of opinion 

ye a sort of a one it fair enough here may be but overr
seven thousand dollar ledg are scarc though

that sheba may be rich enough but we dont own it and besid the rock
is so full of base metal that all the scienc in the world cant work
it well not starv here but well not get rich im afraid 

so you think the prospect is pretti poor 

no name for it 

well wed better go back hadnt we 

oh not yetof cours not well tri it a riffl first 

suppos nowthi is mere a supposit you knowsuppos you could
find a ledg that would yield say a hundr and fifti dollar a ton
would that satisfi you 

tri us onc  from the whole parti

or supposemer a supposit of coursesuppos you were to find a
ledg that would yield two thousand dollar a tonwould that satisfi
you 

herewhat do you mean what are you come at is there some mysteri
behind all this 

never mind i am not say anyth you know perfect well there
are no rich mine hereof cours you do becaus you have been around
and examin for yourselv anybodi would know that that had been
around but just for the sake of argument supposein a kind of general
waysuppos some person were to tell you that twothousanddollar ledg
were simpli contemptiblecontempt understandand that right yonder
in sight of this veri cabin there were pile of pure gold and pure
silverocean of itenough to make you all rich in twentyfour hour
come 

i should say he was as crazi as a loon  said old ballou but wild with
excit nevertheless

gentlemen  said i i dont say anythingi havent been around you
know and of cours dont know anythingbut all i ask of you is to cast
your eye on that for instanc and tell me what you think of it  and i
toss my treasur befor them

there was an eager scrambl for it and a close of head togeth over
it under the candlelight then old ballou said

think of it i think it is noth but a lot of granit rubbish and
nasti glitter mica that isnt worth ten cent an acr 

so vanish my dream so melt my wealth away so toppl my airi
castl to the earth and left me stricken and forlorn

moral i observ then that all that glitter is not gold 

mr ballou said i could go further than that and lay it up among my
treasur of knowledg that noth that glitter is gold so i learn
then onc for all that gold in it nativ state is but dull
unornament stuff and that onli lowborn metal excit the admir
of the ignor with an ostentati glitter howev like the rest of
the world i still go on underr men of gold and glorifi men of
mica commonplac human natur cannot rise abov that




chapter xxix

true knowledg of the natur of silver mine came fast enough we went
out prospecting with mr ballou we climb the mountain side and
clamber among sagebrush rock and snow till we were readi to drop
with exhaust but found no silvernor yet ani gold day after day we
did this now and then we came upon hole burrow a few feet into the
decliv and appar abandon and now and then we found one or
two listless men still burrow but there was no appear of silver
these hole were the begin of tunnel and the purpos was to drive
them hundr of feet into the mountain and some day tap the hidden
ledg where the silver was some day it seem far enough away and
veri hopeless and dreari day after day we toil and climb and
search and we younger partner grew sicker and still sicker of the
promiseless toil at last we halt under a beetl rampart of rock
which project from the earth high upon the mountain mr ballou broke
off some fragment with a hammer and examin them long and attent
with a small eyeglass threw them away and broke off more said this
rock was quartz and quartz was the sort of rock that contain silver
contain it i had thought that at least it would be cake on the
outsid of it like a kind of veneer he still broke off piec and
critic examin them now and then wet the piec with his tongu
and appli the glass at last he exclaim

wev got it 

we were full of anxieti in a moment the rock was clean and white where
it was broken and across it ran a rag thread of blue he said that
that littl thread had silver in it mix with base metal such as lead
and antimoni and other rubbish and that there was a speck or two of
gold visibl after a great deal of effort we manag to discern some
littl fine yellow speck and judg that a coupl of ton of them
mass togeth might make a gold dollar possibl we were not
jubil but mr ballou said there were wors ledg in the world than
that he save what he call the richest piec of the rock in order
to determin it valu by the process call the fireassay  then we
name the mine monarch of the mountains modesti of nomenclatur is not
a promin featur in the mine and mr ballou wrote out and stuck up
the follow notic  preserv a copi to be enter upon the book in
the mine record offic in the town

notic 

we the undersign claim three claim of three hundr feet each
and one for discoveri on this silverbear quartz lead or lode
extend north and south from this notic with all it dip
spur and angl variat and sinuos togeth with fifti
feet of ground on either side for work the same 

we put our name to it and tri to feel that our fortun were made
but when we talk the matter all over with mr ballou we felt depress
and dubious he said that this surfac quartz was not all there was of
our mine but that the wall or ledg of rock call the monarch of the
mountain  extend down hundr and hundr of feet into the earth
he illustr by say it was like a curbston and maintain a
near uniform thicknesssay twenti feetaway down into the bowel of
the earth and was perfect distinct from the case rock on each side
of it and that it kept to itself and maintain it distinct
charact alway no matter how deep it extend into the earth or how
far it stretch itself through and across the hill and valley he
said it might be a mile deep and ten mile long for all we knew and
that wherev we bore into it abov ground or below we would find gold
and silver in it but no gold or silver in the meaner rock it was case
between and he said that down in the great depth of the ledg was it
rich and the deeper it went the richer it grew therefor instead
of work here on the surfac we must either bore down into the rock
with a shaft till we came to where it was richsay a hundr feet or so
or els we must go down into the valley and bore a long tunnel into the
mountain side and tap the ledg far under the earth to do either was
plain the labor of month for we could blast and bore onli a few feet
a daysom five or six but this was not all he said that after we
got the ore out it must be haul in wagon to a distant silvermil
ground up and the silver extract by a tedious and cost process our
fortun seem a centuri away

but we went to work we decid to sink a shaft so for a week we
climb the mountain laden with pick drill gad crowbar shovel
can of blast powder and coil of fuse and strove with might and main
at first the rock was broken and loos and we dug it up with pick and
threw it out with shovel and the hole progress veri well but the
rock becam more compact present and gad and crowbar came into
play but short noth could make an impress but blast powder

that was the weariest work one of us held the iron drill in it place
and anoth would strike with an eightpound sledgeit was like drive
nail on a larg scale in the cours of an hour or two the drill would
reach a depth of two or three feet make a hole a coupl of inch in
diamet we would put in a charg of powder insert half a yard of
fuse pour in sand and gravel and ram it down then light the fuse and
run when the explos came and the rock and smoke shot into the air
we would go back and find about a bushel of that hard rebelli quartz
jolt out noth more one week of this satisfi me i resign
clagget and oliph follow our shaft was onli twelv feet deep we
decid that a tunnel was the thing we want

so we went down the mountain side and work a week at the end of which
time we had blast a tunnel about deep enough to hide a hogshead in and
judg that about nine hundr feet more of it would reach the ledg
i resign again and the other boy onli held out one day longer
we decid that a tunnel was not what we want we want a ledg that
was alreadi develop  there were none in the camp

we drop the monarch for the time be

meantim the camp was fill up with peopl and there was a constant
grow excit about our humboldt mine we fell victim to the
epidem and strain everi nerv to acquir more feet  we prospect
and took up new claim put notices on them and gave them grandiloqu
name we trade some of our feet for feet in other peopl claim
in a littl while we own larg in the gray eagl  the columbiana 
the branch mint  the maria jane  the univers  the
roothogordi  the samson and delilah  the treasur trove  the
golconda  the sultana  the boomerang  the great republ  the
grand mogul  and fifti other mines that had never been molest by a
shovel or scratch with a pick we had not less than thirti thousand
feet apiec in the richest mine on earth as the frenzi cant
phrase itand were in debt to the butcher we were stark mad with
excitementdrunk with happinesssmoth under mountain of
prospect wealtharrog compassion toward the plod million
who knew not our marvel canyonbut our credit was not good at the
grocer

it was the strangest phase of life one can imagin it was a beggar
revel there was noth do in the districtno miningno mill
no product effortno incomeand not enough money in the entir camp
to buy a corner lot in an eastern villag hard and yet a stranger
would have suppos he was walk among bloat millionair

chapter xxx

i met men at everi turn who own from one thousand to thirti thousand
feet in undevelop silver mine everi singl foot of which they
believ would short be worth from fifti to a thousand dollarsand as
often as ani other way they were men who had not twentyf dollar in
the world everi man you met had his new mine to boast of and his
specimens readi and if the opportun offer he would infal
back you into a corner and offer as a favor to you not to him to part
with just a few feet in the golden age  or the sarah jane  or some
other unknown stack of crop for money enough to get a squar meal
with as the phrase went and you were never to reveal that he had made
you the offer at such a ruinous price for it was onli out of friendship
for you that he was will to make the sacrific then he would fish a
piec of rock out of his pocket and after look mysteri around as
if he fear he might be waylaid and rob if caught with such wealth in
his possess he would dab the rock against his tongu clap an
eyeglass to it and exclaim

look at that right there in that red dirt see it see the speck of
gold and the streak of silver that from the uncl abe there a
hundr thousand ton like that in sight right in sight mind you
and when we get down on it and the ledg come in solid it will be the
richest thing in the world look at the assay i dont want you to
believ melook at the assay 

then he would get out a greasi sheet of paper which show that the
portion of rock assay had given evid of contain silver and gold
in the proport of so mani hundr or thousand of dollar to the ton


i littl knew then that the custom was to hunt out the richest piec of
rock and get it assay veri often that piec the size of a filbert
was the onli fragment in a ton that had a particl of metal in itand
yet the assay made it pretend to repres the averag valu of the ton
of rubbish it came from

on such a system of assay as that the humboldt world had gone crazi
on the author of such assay it newspap correspond were
froth about rock worth four and seven thousand dollar a ton

and doe the reader rememb a few page back the calcul of a
quot correspond wherebi the ore is to be mine and ship all the
way to england the metal extract and the gold and silver content
receiv back by the miner as clear profit the copper antimoni and
other thing in the ore be suffici to pay all the expens
incur everybodi head was full of such calculations as those
such rave insan rather few peopl took work into their
calculationsor outlay of money either except the work and expenditur
of other peopl

we never touch our tunnel or our shaft again whi becaus we judg
that we had learn the real secret of success in silver miningwhich
was not to mine the silver ourselv by the sweat of our brow and the
labor of our hand but to sell the ledg to the dull slave of toil and
let them do the mine

befor leav carson the secretari and i had purchas feet from
various esmeralda straggler we had expect immedi return of
bullion but were onli afflict with regular and constant assessments
insteaddemand for money wherewith to develop the said mine these
assess had grown so oppress that it seem necessari to look into
the matter person therefor i project a pilgrimag to carson and
thenc to esmeralda i bought a hors and start in compani with
mr ballou and a gentleman name ollendorff a prussiannot the parti
who has inflict so much suffer on the world with his wretch
foreign grammar with their intermin repetit of question which
never have occur and are never like to occur in ani convers
among human be we rode through a snowstorm for two or three day
and arriv at honey lake smith  a sort of isol inn on the carson
river it was a twostori log hous situat on a small knoll in the
midst of the vast basin or desert through which the sick carson wind
it melancholi way close to the hous were the overland stage stabl
built of sundri brick there was not anoth build within sever
leagu of the place toward sunset about twenti haywagon arriv and
camp around the hous and all the teamster came in to suppera veri
veri rough set there were one or two overland stage driver there
also and half a dozen vagabond and straggler consequ the hous
was well crowd

we walk out after supper and visit a small indian camp in the
vicin the indian were in a great hurri about someth and were
pack up and get away as fast as they could in their broken
english they said bymbi heap water  and by the help of sign made
us understand that in their opinion a flood was come the weather was
perfect clear and this was not the raini season there was about a
foot of water in the insignific riveror mayb two feet the stream
was not wider than a back alley in a villag and it bank were scarc
higher than a man head

so where was the flood to come from we canvass the subject awhil
and then conclud it was a ruse and that the indian had some better
reason for leav in a hurri than fear of a flood in such an
exceed dri time

at seven in the even we went to bed in the second storywith our
cloth on as usual and all three in the same bed for everi avail
space on the floor chair etc was in request and even then there
was bare room for the hous of the inn guest an hour later we
were awaken by a great turmoil and spring out of bed we pick our
way nimbl among the rank of snore teamster on the floor and got to
the front window of the long room a glanc reveal a strang
spectacl under the moonlight the crook carson was full to the brim
and it water were rage and foam in the wildest waysweep
around the sharp bend at a furious speed and bear on their surfac a
chao of log brush and all sort of rubbish a depress where it
bed had onc been in other time was alreadi fill and in one or two
place the water was begin to wash over the main bank men were
fli hither and thither bring cattl and wagon close up to the
hous for the spot of high ground on which it stood extend onli some
thirti feet in front and about a hundr in the rear close to the old
river bed just spoken of stood a littl log stabl and in this our
hors were lodg

while we look the water increas so fast in this place that in a few
minut a torrent was roar by the littl stabl and it margin
encroach steadili on the log we sudden realiz that this flood
was not a mere holiday spectacl but meant damageand not onli to the
small log stabl but to the overland build close to the main river
for the wave had now come ashor and were creep about the foundat
and invad the great haycorr adjoin we ran down and join the
crowd of excit men and frighten anim we wade kneedeep into the
log stabl unfasten the hors and wade out almost waistdeep so
fast the water increas then the crowd rush in a bodi to the
haycorr and began to tumbl down the huge stack of bale hay and roll
the bale up on the high ground by the hous meantim it was discov
that owen an overland driver was miss and a man ran to the larg
stabl and wade in boottop deep discov him asleep in his bed
awok him and wade out again but owen was drowsi and resum his
nap but onli for a minut or two for present he turn in his bed
his hand drop over the side and came in contact with the cold water
it was up level with the mattress he wade out breastdeep almost
and the next moment the sunburn brick melt down like sugar and the
big build crumbl to a ruin and was wash away in a twinkl

at eleven oclock onli the roof of the littl log stabl was out of
water and our inn was on an island in midocean as far as the eye
could reach in the moonlight there was no desert visibl but onli a
level wast of shine water the indian were true prophet but how
did they get their inform i am not abl to answer the question
we remain coop up eight day and night with that curious crew
swear drink and card play were the order of the day and
occasion a fight was thrown in for varieti dirt and verminbut let
us forget those featur their profus is simpli inconceivableit is
better that they remain so

there were two menhowev this chapter is long enough




chapter xxxi

there were two men in the compani who caus me particular discomfort
one was a littl swede about twentyf year old who knew onli one
song and he was forev sing it by day we were all crowd into one
small stifl barroom and so there was no escap this person
music through all the profan whiskyguzzl old sledge and
quarrel his monoton song meander with never a variat in it
tiresom same and it seem to me at last that i would be content
to die in order to be rid of the tortur the other man was a stalwart
ruffian call arkansa  who carri two revolv in his belt and a
bowi knife project from his boot and who was alway drunk and alway
suffer for a fight but he was so fear that nobodi would
accommod him he would tri all manner of littl wari ruse to entrap
somebodi into an offens remark and his face would light up now and
then when he fanci he was fair on the scent of a fight but

they embrac with drunken affect on the landlord part and
unrespons toler on the part of arkansa who bribe by a drink

happi to have escap butcheri that he went on talk when he ought to

with that arkansa began to shoot and the landlord to clamber over
bench men and everi sort of obstacl in a frantic desir to escap
in the midst of the wild hubbub the landlord crash through a glass
door and as arkansa charg after him the landlord wife sudden
appear in the doorway and confront the desperado with a pair of
scissor her furi was magnific with head erect and flash eye
she stood a moment and then advanc with her weapon rais the
astonish ruffian hesit and then fell back a step she follow
she back him step by step into the middl of the barroom and then
while the wonder crowd close up and gaze she gave him such anoth
tonguelash as never a cow and shamefac braggart got befor
perhap as she finish and retir victori a roar of applaus
shook the hous and everi man order drink for the crowd in one and
the same breath

the lesson was entir suffici the reign of terror was over and
the arkansa domin broken for good dure the rest of the season
of island captiv there was one man who sat apart in a state of
perman humili never mix in ani quarrel or utter a boast
and never resent the insult the onc cring crew now constant
level at him and that man was arkansa 

by the fifth or sixth morn the water had subsid from the land but
the stream in the old river bed was still high and swift and there was no
possibl of cross it on the eighth it was still too high for an
entir safe passag but life in the inn had becom next to
insupport by reason of the dirt drunken fight etc and so
we made an effort to get away in the midst of a heavi snowstorm we
embark in a cano take our saddl aboard and tow our hors
after us by their halter the prussian ollendorff was in the bow
with a paddl ballou paddl in the middl and i sat in the stern
hold the halter when the hors lost their foot and began to
swim ollendorff got frighten for there was great danger that the
hors would make our aim uncertain and it was plain that if we fail
to land at a certain spot the current would throw us off and almost
sure cast us into the main carson which was a boil torrent now
such a catastroph would be death in all probabl for we would be
swept to sea in the sink or overturn and drown we warn
ollendorff to keep his wit about him and handl himself care but
it was useless the moment the bow touch the bank he made a spring and
the cano whirl upsid down in tenfoot water

ollendorff seiz some brush and drag himself ashor but ballou and i
had to swim for it encumb with our overcoat but we held on to the
cano and although we were wash down near to the carson we manag
to push the boat ashor and make a safe land we were cold and
watersoak but safe the hors made a land too but our saddl
were gone of cours we tie the anim in the sagebrush and there
they had to stay for twentyfour hour we bale out the cano and
ferri over some food and blanket for them but we slept one more night
in the inn befor make anoth ventur on our journey

the next morn it was still snow furious when we got away with our
new stock of saddl and accoutr we mount and start the
snow lay so deep on the ground that there was no sign of a road
percept and the snowfal was so thick that we could not see more
than a hundr yard ahead els we could have guid our cours by the
mountain rang the case look dubious but ollendorff said his
instinct was as sensit as ani compass and that he could strike a
beeline for carson citi and never diverg from it he said that if he
were to straggl a singl point out of the true line his instinct would
assail him like an outrag conscienc consequ we drop into his
wake happi and content for half an hour we poke along warili enough
but at the end of that time we came upon a fresh trail and ollendorff
shout proud

i knew i was as dead certain as a compass boy here we are right in
somebodi track that will hunt the way for us without ani troubl
let hurri up and join compani with the parti 

so we put the hors into as much of a trot as the deep snow would allow
and befor long it was evid that we were gain on our predecessor
for the track grew more distinct we hurri along and at the end of
an hour the track look still newer and fresherbut what surpris us
was that the number of travel in advanc of us seem to steadili
increas we wonder how so larg a parti came to be travel at such
a time and in such a solitud somebodi suggest that it must be a
compani of soldier from the fort and so we accept that solut and
jog along a littl faster still for they could not be far off now
but the track still multipli and we began to think the platoon of
soldier was miracul expand into a regimentballou said they had
alreadi increas to five hundr present he stop his hors and
said

boy these are our own track and wev actual been circuss round
and round in a circl for more than two hour out here in this blind
desert by georg this is perfect hydraul 

then the old man wax wroth and abus he call ollendorff all
manner of hard namessaid he never saw such a lurid fool as he was and
end with the peculiar venom opinion that he did not know as much
as a logarythm 

we certain had been follow our own track ollendorff and his
mental compass were in disgrac from that moment

after all our hard travel here we were on the bank of the stream again
with the inn beyond dim outlin through the drive snowfal while
we were consid what to do the young swede land from the cano and
took his pedestrian way carsonward sing his same tiresom song
about his sister and his brother and the child in the grave with it
mother  and in a short minut fade and disappear in the white
oblivion he was never heard of again he no doubt got bewild and
lost and fatigu deliv him over to sleep and sleep betray him to
death possibl he follow our treacher track till he becam
exhaust and drop

present the overland stage ford the now fast reced stream and
start toward carson on it first trip sinc the flood came we
hesit no longer now but took up our march in it wake and trot
merrili along for we had good confid in the driver bump of
local but our hors were no match for the fresh stage team we
were soon left out of sight but it was no matter for we had the deep
rut the wheel made for a guid by this time it was three in the
afternoon and consequ it was not veri long befor night cameand
not with a linger twilight but with a sudden shut down like a
cellar door as is it habit in that countri the snowfal was still as
thick as ever and of cours we could not see fifteen step befor us
but all about us the white glare of the snowb enabl us to discern
the smooth sugarloaf mound made by the cover sagebush and just in
front of us the two faint groov which we knew were the steadili fill
and slowli disappear wheeltrack

now those sagebush were all about the same heightthre or four feet
they stood just about seven feet apart all over the vast desert each of
them was a mere snowmound now in ani direct that you proceed the
same as in a well laid out orchard you would find yourself move down a
distinct defin avenu with a row of these snowmound an either side
of itan avenu the customari width of a road nice and level in it
breadth and rise at the side in the most natur way by reason of
the mound but we had not thought of this then imagin the chilli
thrill that shot through us when it final occur to us far in the
night that sinc the last faint trace of the wheeltrack had long ago
been buri from sight we might now be wander down a mere sagebrush
avenu mile away from the road and diverg further and further away
from it all the time have a cake of ice slip down one back is
placid comfort compar to it there was a sudden leap and stir of blood
that had been asleep for an hour and as sudden a rous of all the
drows activ in our mind and bodi we were aliv and awak at
onceand shake and quak with constern too there was an
instant halt and dismount a bend low and an anxious scan of
the roadb useless of cours for if a faint depress could not be
discern from an altitud of four or five feet abov it it certain
could not with one nose near against it




chapter xxxii

we seem to be in a road but that was no proof we test this by
walk off in various directionsth regular snowmound and the
regular avenu between them convinc each man that he had found the
true road and that the other had found onli fals one plain the
situat was desper we were cold and stiff and the hors were
tire we decid to build a sagebrush fire and camp out till morn
this was wise becaus if we were wander from the right road and the
snowstorm continu anoth day our case would be the next thing to
hopeless if we kept on

all agre that a camp fire was what would come nearest to save us
now and so we set about build it we could find no match and so
we tri to make shift with the pistol not a man in the parti had ever
tri to do such a thing befor but not a man in the parti doubt that
it could be done and without ani troublebecaus everi man in the parti
had read about it in book mani a time and had natur come to believ
it with trust simplic just as he had long ago accept and
believ that other common bookfraud about indian and lost hunter
make a fire by rub two dri stick togeth

we huddl togeth on our knee in the deep snow and the hors put
their nose togeth and bow their patient head over us and while the
featheri flake eddi down and turn us into a group of white statuari
we proceed with the moment experi we broke twig from a sage
bush and pile them on a littl clear place in the shelter of our
bodi in the cours of ten or fifteen minut all was readi and then
while convers ceas and our puls beat low with anxious suspens
ollendorff appli his revolv pull the trigger and blew the pile
clear out of the counti it was the flattest failur that ever was

this was distress but it pale befor a greater horrorth hors
were gone i had been appoint to hold the bridl but in my absorb
anxieti over the pistol experi i had unconsci drop them and
the releas anim had walk off in the storm it was useless to tri
to follow them for their footfal could make no sound and one could
pass within two yard of the creatur and never see them we gave them
up without an effort at recov them and curs the lie book that
said hors would stay by their master for protect and companionship
in a distress time like our

we were miser enough befor we felt still more forlorn now
patient but with blight hope we broke more stick and pile them
and onc more the prussian shot them into annihil plain to
light a fire with a pistol was an art requir practic and experi
and the middl of a desert at midnight in a snowstorm was not a good
place or time for the acquir of the accomplish we gave it up and
tri the other each man took a coupl of stick and fell to chafe
them togeth at the end of half an hour we were thorough chill
and so were the stick we bitter execr the indian the hunter
and the book that had betray us with the silli devic and wonder
dismal what was next to be done at this critic moment mr ballou
fish out four match from the rubbish of an overlook pocket to
have found four gold bar would have seem poor and cheap good luck
compar to this

one cannot think how good a match look under such circumstancesor how
lovabl and precious and sacr beauti to the eye this time we
gather stick with high hope and when mr ballou prepar to light
the first match there was an amount of interest centr upon him that
page of write could not describ the match burn hope a
moment and then went out it could not have carri more regret with it
if it had been a human life the next match simpli flash and die
the wind puf the third one out just as it was on the immin verg of
success we gather togeth closer than ever and develop a
solicitud that was rapt and pain as mr ballou scratch our last
hope on his leg it lit burn blue and sick and then bud into a
robust flame shade it with his hand the old gentleman bent
gradual down and everi heart went with himeverybodi too for that
matterand blood and breath stood still the flame touch the stick
at last took gradual hold upon themhesitatedtook a stronger hold
hesit againheld it breath five heartbreak second then gave a
sort of human gasp and went out

nobodi said a word for sever minut it was a solemn sort of silenc
even the wind put on a stealthi sinist quiet and made no more nois
than the fall flake of snow final a sadvoic convers
began and it was soon appar that in each of our heart lay the
convict that this was our last night with the live i had so hope
that i was the onli one who felt so when the other calm acknowledg
their convict it sound like the summon itself ollendorff said

brother let us die togeth and let us go without one hard feel
toward each other let us forget and forgiv bygon i know that you
have felt hard toward me for turn over the cano and for know too
much and lead you round and round in the snowbut i meant well
forgiv me i acknowledg freeli that i have had hard feel against
mr ballou for abus me and call me a logarythm which is a thing i
do not know what but no doubt a thing consid disgrac and
unbecom in america and it has scarc been out of my mind and has
hurt me a great dealbut let it go i forgiv mr ballou with all my
heart and

poor ollendorff broke down and the tear came he was not alon for i
was cri too and so was mr ballou ollendorff got his voic again
and forgav me for thing i had done and said then he got out his
bottl of whiski and said that whether he live or die he would never
touch anoth drop he said he had given up all hope of life and
although illprepar was readi to submit humbl to his fate that he
wish he could be spare a littl longer not for ani selfish reason
but to make a thorough reform in his charact and by devot himself
to help the poor nurs the sick and plead with the peopl to
guard themselv against the evil of intemper make his life a
benefic exampl to the young and lay it down at last with the
precious reflect that it had not been live in vain he end by
say that his reform should begin at this moment even here in the
presenc of death sinc no longer time was to be vouchsaf wherein to
prosecut it to men help and benefitand with that he threw away the
bottl of whiski

mr ballou made remark of similar purport and began the reform he could
not live to continu by throw away the ancient pack of card that had
solac our captiv dure the flood and made it bearabl

he said he never gambl but still was satisfi that the meddl with
card in ani way was immor and injuri and no man could be wholli
pure and blemishless without eschew them and therefor  continu
he in do this act i alreadi feel more in sympathi with that
spiritu saturnalia necessari to entir and obsolet reform  these
roll syllabl touch him as no intellig eloqu could have
done and the old man sob with a mourn not unmingl with
satisfact

my own remark were of the same tenor as those of my comrad and i know
that the feel that prompt them were heartfelt and sincer we were
all sincer and all deepli move and earnest for we were in the
presenc of death and without hope i threw away my pipe and in do
it felt that at last i was free of a hate vice and one that had ridden
me like a tyrant all my day while i yet talk the thought of the
good i might have done in the world and the still greater good i might
now do with these new incent and higher and better aim to guid me
if i could onli be spare a few year longer overcam me and the tear
came again we put our arm about each other neck and await the
warn drowsi that preced death by freez

it came steal over us present and then we bade each other a last
farewel a delici dreami wrought it web about my yield
sens while the snowflak wove a wind sheet about my conquer
bodi oblivion came the battl of life was done




chapter xxxiii

i do not know how long i was in a state of forget but it seem
an age a vagu conscious grew upon me by degre and then came a
gather anguish of pain in my limb and through all my bodi i
shudder the thought flit through my brain this is deaththi is
the hereaft 

then came a white upheav at my side and a voic said with bitter

will some gentleman be so good as to kick me behind 

it was ballouat least it was a towzl snow imag in a sit postur
with ballou voic

i rose up and there in the gray dawn not fifteen step from us were
the frame build of a stage station and under a shed stood our still
saddl and bridl hors

an arch snowdrift broke up now and ollendorff emerg from it and
the three of us sat and stare at the hous without speak a word
we realli had noth to say we were like the profan man who could not
do the subject justic  the whole situat was so pain ridicul
and humili that word were tame and we did not know where to
commenc anyhow

the joy in our heart at our deliver was poison wellnigh
dissip inde we present began to grow pettish by degre and
sullen and then angri at each other angri at ourselv angri at
everyth in general we moodili dust the snow from our cloth and
in unsoci singl file plow our way to the hors unsaddl them
and sought shelter in the station

i have scarc exagger a detail of this curious and absurd
adventur it occur almost exact as i have state it we actual
went into camp in a snowdrift in a desert at midnight in a storm
forlorn and hopeless within fifteen step of a comfort inn

for two hour we sat apart in the station and rumin in disgust
the mysteri was gone now and it was plain enough whi the hors had
desert us without a doubt they were under that shed a quarter of a
minut after they had left us and they must have overheard and enjoy
all our confess and lament

after breakfast we felt better and the zest of life soon came back
the world look bright again and exist was as dear to us as ever
present an uneasi came over megrew upon meassail me without
ceas ala my regener was not completei want to smoke
i resist with all my strength but the flesh was weak i wander away
alon and wrestl with myself an hour i recal my promis of reform
and preach to myself persuas upbraid exhaust but it
was all vain i short found myself sneak among the snowdrift
hunt for my pipe i discov it after a consider search and
crept away to hide myself and enjoy it i remain behind the barn a
good while ask myself how i would feel if my braver stronger truer
comrad should catch me in my degrad at last i lit the pipe and
no human be can feel meaner and baser than i did then i was asham
of be in my own piti compani still dread discoveri i felt
that perhap the further side of the barn would be somewhat safer and so
i turn the corner as i turn the one corner smoke ollendorff
turn the other with his bottl to his lip and between us sat
unconsci ballou deep in a game of solitaire with the old greasi
card

absurd could go no farther we shook hand and agre to say no more
about reform and exampl to the rise generat 

the station we were at was at the verg of the twentysixmil desert
if we had approach it half an hour earlier the night befor we must
have heard men shout there and fire pistol for they were expect
some sheep drover and their flock and knew that they would infal
get lost and wander out of reach of help unless guid by sound

while we remain at the station three of the drover arriv near
exhaust with their wander but two other of their parti were never
heard of afterward

we reach carson in due time and took a rest this rest togeth with
prepar for the journey to esmeralda kept us there a week and the
delay gave us the opportun to be present at the trial of the great
landslid case of hyde vs morganan episod which is famous in nevada
to this day after a word or two of necessari explan i will set
down the histori of this singular affair just as it transpir




chapter xxxiv

the mountain are veri high and steep about carson eagl and washo
valleysveri high and veri steep and so when the snow get to melt
off fast in the spring and the warm surfaceearth begin to moisten and
soften the disastr landslid commenc the reader cannot know what

side of a mountain taken off some fine morn and deposit down in the
valley leav a vast treeless unsight scar upon the mountain
front to keep the circumst fresh in his memori all the year that he
may go on live within seventi mile of that place

general buncomb was ship out to nevada in the invoic of territori
offic to be unit state attorney he consid himself a lawyer
of part and he veri much want an opportun to manifest itpart
for the pure gratif of it and part becaus his salari was
territori meagr which is a strong express now the older
citizen of a new territori look down upon the rest of the world with a
calm benevol compass as long as it keep out of the waywhen it
get in the way they snub it sometim this latter take the shape of a
practic joke

one morn dick hyde rode furious up to general buncomb door in
carson citi and rush into his presenc without stop to tie his
hors he seem much excit he told the general that he want him
to conduct a suit for him and would pay him five hundr dollar if he
achiev a victori and then with violent gestur and a world of
profan he pour out his grief he said it was pretti well known
that for some year he had been farm or ranch as the more
customari term is in washo district and make a success thing of
it and furthermor it was known that his ranch was situat just in the
edg of the valley and that tom morgan own a ranch immedi abov

and now the troubl was that one of those hate and dread landslid
had come and slid morgan ranch fenc cabin cattl barn and

vestig of his properti to a depth of about thirtyeight feet morgan

and when i remind him  said hyde weep that it was on top of my

whi didnt i stay on my ranch and hold possess when i see him

perceiv that the weight of it the overwhelm weight of it is in
favor of the plaintiff hyde i have listen also to the remark of
counsel with high interestand especi will i commend the master
and irrefut logic of the distinguish gentleman who repres the
plaintiff but gentlemen let us bewar how we allow mere human
testimoni human ingenu in argument and human idea of equiti to
influenc us at a moment so solemn as this gentlemen it ill becom
us worm as we are to meddl with the decre of heaven it is plain
to me that heaven in it inscrut wisdom has seen fit to move this
defend ranch for a purpos we are but creatur and we must
submit if heaven has chosen to favor the defend morgan in this
mark and wonder manner and if heaven dissatisfi with the
posit of the morgan ranch upon the mountain side has chosen to remov
it to a posit more elig and more advantag for it owner it
ill becom us insect as we are to question the legal of the act or

chapter xxxv

when we final left for esmeralda horseback we had an addit to the
compani in the person of capt john nye the governor brother he had
a good memori and a tongu hung in the middl this is a combin
which give immort to convers capt john never suffer the
talk to flag or falter onc dure the hundr and twenti mile of the
journey in addit to his convers power he had one or two
other endow of a mark charact one was a singular handiness
about do anyth and everyth from lay out a railroad or
organ a polit parti down to sew on button shoe a hors
or set a broken leg or a hen anoth was a spirit of accommod
that prompt him to take the need difficulti and perplex of
anybodi and everybodi upon his own shoulder at ani and all time and
dispos of them with admir facil and alacrityh he alway
manag to find vacant bed in crowd inn and plenti to eat in the
emptiest larder and final wherev he met a man woman or child in
camp inn or desert he either knew such parti person or had been
acquaint with a relat of the same such anoth travel comrad
was never seen befor i cannot forbear give a specimen of the way in
which he overcam difficulti on the second day out we arriv veri
tire and hungri at a poor littl inn in the desert and were told that
the hous was full no provis on hand and neither hay nor barley to
spare for the horsesmust move on the rest of us want to hurri on
while it was yet light but capt john insist on stop awhil
we dismount and enter there was no welcom for us on ani face
capt john began his blandish and within twenti minut he had
accomplish the follow thing viz found old acquaint in three
teamster discov that he use to go to school with the landlord
mother recogn his wife as a ladi whose life he had save onc in
california by stop her runaway hors mend a child broken toy
and won the favor of it mother a guest of the inn help the hostler
bleed a hors and prescrib for anoth hors that had the heaves
treat the entir parti three time at the landlord bar produc a
later paper than anybodi had seen for a week and sat himself down to read
the news to a deepli interest audienc the result sum up was as
follow the hostler found plenti of feed for our hors we had a trout
supper an exceed sociabl time after it good bed to sleep in and
a surpris breakfast in the morningand when we left we left lament
by all capt john had some bad trait but he had some uncommon
valuabl one to offset them with

esmeralda was in mani respect anoth humboldt but in a littl more
forward state the claim we had been pay assess on were
entir worthless and we threw them away the princip one crop
out of the top of a knoll that was fourteen feet high and the inspir
board of director were run a tunnel under that knoll to strike the
ledg the tunnel would have to be seventi feet long and would then
strike the ledg at the same dept that a shaft twelv feet deep would
have reach the board were live on the assess  n b this
hint come too late for the enlighten of new york silver miner they
have alreadi learn all about this neat trick by experi  the board
had no desir to strike the ledg know that it was as barren of
silver as a curbston this reminisc call to mind jim townsend
tunnel he had paid assess on a mine call the daley till he was
wellnigh penniless final an assess was levi to run a tunnel
two hundr and fifti feet on the daley and townsend went up on the hill
to look into matter

he found the daley crop out of the apex of an exceed
sharppoint peak and a coupl of men up there facing the propos
tunnel townsend made a calcul then he said to the men

so you have taken a contract to run a tunnel into this hill two hundr
and fifti feet to strike this ledg 

ye sir 

well do you know that you have got one of the most expens and
arduous undertak befor you that was ever conceiv by man 

whi nohow is that 

becaus this hill is onli twentyf feet through from side to side
and so you have got to build two hundr and twentyf feet of your
tunnel on trestlework 

the way of silver mine board are exceed dark and sinuous

we took up various claim and commenc shaft and tunnel on them but
never finish ani of them we had to do a certain amount of work on
each to hold it els other parti could seiz our properti after the
expir of ten day we were alway hunt up new claim and do a
littl work on them and then wait for a buyerwho never came we
never found ani ore that would yield more than fifti dollar a ton and
as the mill charg fifti dollar a ton for work ore and extract
the silver our pocketmoney melt steadili away and none return to
take it place we live in a littl cabin and cook for ourselv and
altogeth it was a hard life though a hope onefor we never ceas
to expect fortun and a custom to burst upon us some day

at last when flour reach a dollar a pound and money could not be
borrow on the best secur at less than eight per cent a month i
be without the secur too i abandon mine and went to mill
that is to say i went to work as a common labor in a quartz mill at
ten dollar a week and board




chapter xxxvi

i had alreadi learn how hard and long and dismal a task it is to burrow
down into the bowel of the earth and get out the covet ore and now i
learn that the burrow was onli half the work and that to get the
silver out of the ore was the dreari and labori other half of it
we had to turn out at six in the morn and keep at it till dark
this mill was a sixstamp affair driven by steam six tall upright
rod of iron as larg as a man ankl and heavili shod with a mass of
iron and steel at their lower end were frame togeth like a gate and
these rose and fell one after the other in a ponder danc in an
iron box call a batteri  each of these rod or stamp weigh six
hundr pound one of us stood by the batteri all day long break up
mass of silverbear rock with a sledg and shovel it into the
batteri the ceaseless danc of the stamp pulver the rock to
powder and a stream of water that trickl into the batteri turn it to
a creami past the minutest particl were driven through a fine wire
screen which fit close around the batteri and were wash into great
tub warm by superh steamamalgam pan they are call
the mass of pulp in the pan was kept constant stir up by revolv
muller  a quantiti of quicksilv was kept alway in the batteri and
this seiz some of the liber gold and silver particl and held on
to them quicksilv was shaken in a fine shower into the pan also
about everi half hour through a buckskin sack quantiti of coars
salt and sulphat of copper were ad from time to time to assist the
amalgam by destroy base metal which coat the gold and silver
and would not let it unit with the quicksilv

all these tiresom thing we had to attend to constant stream of
dirti water flow alway from the pan and were carri off in broad
wooden trough to the ravin one would not suppos that atom of gold
and silver would float on top of six inch of water but they did and
in order to catch them coars blanket were laid in the trough and
littl obstruct riffles charg with quicksilv were place here
and there across the trough also these riffl had to be clean and
the blanket wash out everi even to get their precious
accumulationsand after all this etern of troubl one third of the
silver and gold in a ton of rock would find it way to the end of the
trough in the ravin at last and have to be work over again some day
there is noth so aggrav as silver mill there never was ani
idl time in that mill there was alway someth to do it is a piti
that adam could not have gone straight out of eden into a quartz mill in
order to understand the full forc of his doom to earn his bread by the
sweat of his brow  everi now and then dure the day we had to scoop
some pulp out of the pan and tedious wash it in a horn spoonwash
it littl by littl over the edg till at last noth was left but some
littl dull globul of quicksilv in the bottom if they were soft and
yield the pan need some salt or some sulphat of copper or some
other chemic rubbish to assist digest if they were crisp to the
touch and would retain a dint they were freight with all the silver
and gold they could seiz and hold and consequ the pan need a
fresh charg of quicksilv when there was noth els to do one
could alway screen tail  that is to say he could shovel up the
dri sand that had wash down to the ravin through the trough and
dash it against an upright wire screen to free it from pebbl and
prepar it for work over

the process of amalgam differ in the various mill and this
includ chang in style of pan and other machineri and a great
divers of opinion exist as to the best in use but none of the
method employ involv the principl of mill ore without
screen the tail  of all recreat in the world screen
tail on a hot day with a longhandl shovel is the most
undesir

at the end of the week the machineri was stop and we clean up 
that is to say we got the pulp out of the pan and batteri and wash
the mud patient away till noth was left but the long accumul
mass of quicksilv with it imprison treasur this we made into
heavi compact snowbal and pile them up in a bright luxuri heap
for inspect make these snowbal cost me a fine gold ringthat
and ignor togeth for the quicksilv invad the ring with the
same facil with which water satur a spongesepar it
particl and the ring crumbl to piec

we put our pile of quicksilv ball into an iron retort that had a pipe
lead from it to a pail of water and then appli a roast heat
the quicksilv turn to vapor escap through the pipe into the pail
and the water turn it into good wholesom quicksilv again
quicksilv is veri cost and they never wast it on open the
retort there was our week worka lump of pure white frosti look
silver twice as larg as a man head perhap a fifth of the mass was
gold but the color of it did not showwould not have shown if two
third of it had been gold we melt it up and made a solid brick of it
by pour it into an iron brickmould

by such a tedious and labori process were silver brick obtain
this mill was but one of mani other in oper at the time the first
one in nevada was built at egan canyon and was a small insignific
affair and compar most unfavor with some of the immens
establish afterward locat at virginia citi and elsewher

from our brick a littl corner was chip off for the fireassaya
method use to determin the proport of gold silver and base metal
in the mass this is an interest process the chip is hammer out
as thin as paper and weigh on scale so fine and sensit that if you
weigh a twoinch scrap of paper on them and then write your name on the
paper with a cours soft pencil and weigh it again the scale will take
mark notic of the addit

then a littl lead also weigh is roll up with the flake of silver
and the two are melt at a great heat in a small vessel call a cupel
made by compress bone ash into a cupshap in a steel mold the
base metal oxyd and are absorb with the lead into the pore of the
cupel a button or globul of perfect pure gold and silver is left
behind and by weigh it and note the loss the assay know the
proport of base metal the brick contain he has to separ the gold
from the silver now the button is hammer out flat and thin put in
the furnac and kept some time at a red heat after cool it off it is
roll up like a quill and heat in a glass vessel contain nitric
acid the acid dissolv the silver and leav the gold pure and readi to
be weigh on it own merit then salt water is pour into the vessel
contain the dissolv silver and the silver return to palpabl form
again and sink to the bottom noth now remain but to weigh it then
the proport of the sever metal contain in the brick are known
and the assay stamp the valu of the brick upon it surfac

the sagaci reader will know now without be told that the
specul miner in get a fireassay made of a piec of rock from
his mine to help him sell the same was not in the habit of pick out
the least valuabl fragment of rock on his dumppil but quit the
contrari i have seen men hunt over a pile of near worthless quartz
for an hour and at last find a littl piec as larg as a filbert which
was rich in gold and silverand this was reserv for a fireassay of
cours the fireassay would demonstr that a ton of such rock would
yield hundr of dollarsand on such assay mani an utter worthless
mine was sold

assay was a good busi and so some men engag in it
occasion who were not strict scientif and capabl one assay
got such rich result out of all specimen brought to him that in time he
acquir almost a monopoli of the busi but like all men who achiev
success he becam an object of envi and suspicion the other assay
enter into a conspiraci against him and let some promin citizen
into the secret in order to show that they meant fair then they broke
a littl fragment off a carpent grindston and got a stranger to take
it to the popular scientist and get it assay in the cours of an hour
the result camewherebi it appear that a ton of that rock would yield
   in silver and   in gold

due public of the whole matter was made in the paper and the
popular assay left town between two day 

i will remark in pass that i onli remain in the mill busi
one week i told my employ i could not stay longer without an advanc
in my wage that i like quartz mill inde was infatu with it
that i had never befor grown so tender attach to an occup in so
short a time that noth it seem to me gave such scope to
intellectu activ as feed a batteri and screen tail and
noth so stimul the moral attribut as retort bullion and
wash blanketsstil i felt constrain to ask an increas of salari
he said he was pay me ten dollar a week and thought it a good round
sum how much did i want

i said about four hundr thousand dollar a month and board was about
all i could reason ask consid the hard time

i was order off the premis and yet when i look back to those day
and call to mind the exceed hard of the labor i perform in that
mill i onli regret that i did not ask him seven hundr thousand

short after this i began to grow crazi along with the rest of the
popul about the mysteri and wonder cement mine  and to make
prepar to take advantag of ani opportun that might offer to go
and help hunt for it




chapter xxxvii

it was somewher in the neighborhood of mono lake that the marvel
whiteman cement mine was suppos to lie everi now and then it would be
report that mr w had pass stealthili through esmeralda at dead of
night in disguis and then we would have a wild excitementbecaus he
must be steer for his secret mine and now was the time to follow him
in less than three hour after daylight all the hors and mule and
donkey in the vicin would be bought hire or stolen and half the
communiti would be off for the mountain follow in the wake of
whiteman but w would drift about through the mountain gorg for day
togeth in a purposeless sort of way until the provis of the
miner ran out and they would have to go back home i have known it
report at eleven at night in a larg mine camp that whiteman had
just pass through and in two hour the street so quiet befor would
be swarm with men and anim everi individu would be tri to be
veri secret but yet ventur to whisper to just one neighbor that w
had pass through and long befor daylightthi in the dead of
winterth stamped would be complet the camp desert and the whole
popul gone chase after w

the tradit was that in the earli immigr more than twenti year
ago three young german brother who had surviv an indian massacr
on the plain wander on foot through the desert avoid all trail
and road and simpli hold a wester direct and hope to find
california befor they starv or die of fatigu and in a gorg in
the mountain they sat down to rest one day when one of them notic a
curious vein of cement run along the ground shot full of lump of
dull yellow metal they saw that it was gold and that here was a
fortun to be acquir in a singl day the vein was about as wide as a
curbston and fulli two third of it was pure gold everi pound of the
wonder cement was worth wellnigh 

each of the brother load himself with about twentyf pound of it
and then they cover up all trace of the vein made a rude draw of
the local and the princip landmark in the vicin and start
westward again but troubl thicken about them in their wander
one brother fell and broke his leg and the other were oblig to go on
and leav him to die in the wilder anoth worn out and starv
gave up by and by and laid down to die but after two or three week of
incred hardship the third reach the settlement of california
exhaust sick and his mind derang by his suffer he had thrown
away all his cement but a few fragment but these were suffici to set
everybodi wild with excit howev he had had enough of the cement
countri and noth could induc him to lead a parti thither he was
entir content to work on a farm for wage but he gave whiteman his
map and describ the cement region as well as he could and thus
transfer the curs to that gentlemanfor when i had my one accident
glimps of mr w in esmeralda he had been hunt for the lost mine in
hunger and thirst poverti and sick for twelv or thirteen year
some peopl believ he had found it but most peopl believ he had
not i saw a piec of cement as larg as my fist which was said to have
been given to whiteman by the young german and it was of a seduct
natur lump of virgin gold were as thick in it as raisin in a slice
of fruit cake the privileg of work such a mine one week would be
suffici for a man of reason desir

a new partner of our a mr higbi knew whiteman well by sight and a
friend of our a mr van dorn was well acquaint with him and not
onli that but had whiteman promis that he should have a privat hint
in time to enabl him to join the next cement expedit van dorn had
promis to extend the hint to us one even higbi came in great
excit and said he felt certain he had recogn whiteman up town
disguis and in a pretend state of intox in a littl while
van dorn arriv and confirm the news and so we gather in our cabin
and with head close togeth arrang our plan in impress whisper

we were to leav town quiet after midnight in two or three small
parti so as not to attract attent and meet at dawn on the divide
overlook mono lake eight or nine mile distant we were to make no
nois after start and not speak abov a whisper under ani
circumst it was believ that for onc whiteman presenc was
unknown in the town and his expedit unsuspect our conclav broke
up at nine oclock and we set about our prepar dilig and with
profound secreci at eleven oclock we saddl our hors hitch them
with their long riata or lasso and then brought out a side of bacon
a sack of bean a small sack of coffe some sugar a hundr pound of
flour in sack some tin cup and a coffe pot fri pan and some few
other necessari articl all these thing were packed on the back of
a led horseand whoever has not been taught by a spanish adept to pack
an anim let him never hope to do the thing by natur smart that
is imposs higbi had had some experi but was not perfect he
put on the pack saddl a thing like a sawbuck pile the properti on
it and then wound a rope all over and about it and under it everi which
way  take a hitch in it everi now and then and occasion surg
back on it till the hors side sunk in and he gasp for breathbut
everi time the lash grew tight in one place they loosen in anoth
we never did get the load tight all over but we got it so that it would
do after a fashion and then we start in singl file close order
and without a word it was a dark night we kept the middl of the
road and proceed in a slow walk past the row of cabin and whenev
a miner came to his door i trembl for fear the light would shine on us
an excit curios but noth happen we began the long wind
ascent of the canyon toward the divid  and present the cabin began
to grow infrequ and the interv between them wider and wider and
then i began to breath toler freeli and feel less like a thief and a
murder i was in the rear lead the pack hors as the ascent grew
steeper he grew proportion less satisfi with his cargo and began
to pull back on his riata occasion and delay progress my comrad
were pass out of sight in the gloom i was get anxious i coax
and bulli the pack hors till i present got him into a trot and then
the tin cup and pan strung about his person frighten him and he ran
his riata was wound around the pummel of my saddl and so as he went by
he drag me from my hors and the two anim travel brisk on
without me but i was not aloneth loosen cargo tumbl overboard
from the pack hors and fell close to me it was abreast of almost the
last cabin

a miner came out and said

hello 

i was thirti step from him and knew he could not see me it was so veri
dark in the shadow of the mountain so i lay still anoth head
appear in the light of the cabin door and present the two men walk
toward me they stop within ten step of me and one said

sh listen 

i could not have been in a more distress state if i had been escap
justic with a price on my head then the miner appear to sit down on
a boulder though i could not see them distinct enough to be veri sure
what they did one said

i heard a nois as plain as i ever heard anyth it seem to be
about there

a stone whizz by my head i flatten myself out in the dust like a
postag stamp and thought to myself if he mend his aim ever so littl
he would probabl hear anoth nois in my heart now i execr
secret expedit i promis myself that this should be my last
though the sierra were rib with cement vein then one of the men
said

ill tell you what welch knew what he was talk about when he said
he saw whiteman today i heard horsesthat was the nois i am go
down to welch right away 

they left and i was glad i did not care whither they went so they
went i was will they should visit welch and the sooner the better

as soon as they close their cabin door my comrad emerg from the
gloom they had caught the hors and were wait for a clear coast
again we remount the cargo on the pack hors and got under way and
as day broke we reach the divide and join van dorn then we
journey down into the valley of the lake and feel secur we halt
to cook breakfast for we were tire and sleepi and hungri three hour
later the rest of the popul file over the divide in a long
process and drift off out of sight around the border of the lake

whether or not my accid had produc this result we never knew but at
least one thing was certainth secret was out and whiteman would not
enter upon a search for the cement mine this time we were fill with
chagrin

we held a council and decid to make the best of our misfortun and
enjoy a week holiday on the border of the curious lake mono it is
sometim call and sometim the dead sea of california  it is one
of the strangest freak of natur to be found in ani land but it is
hard ever mention in print and veri seldom visit becaus it lie
away off the usual rout of travel and besid is so difficult to get at
that onli men content to endur the roughest life will consent to take
upon themselv the discomfort of such a trip on the morn of our
second day we travel around to a remot and particular wild spot on
the border of the lake where a stream of fresh icecold water enter
it from the mountain side and then we went regular into camp we
hire a larg boat and two shotgun from a lone ranchman who live
some ten mile further on and made readi for comfort and recreat
we soon got thorough acquaint with the lake and all it
peculiar

the lake is two hundr feet deep and it sluggish water are so strong
with alkali that if you onli dip the most hopeless soil garment into
them onc or twice and wring it out it will be found as clean as if it
had been through the ablest of washerwomen hand while we camp
there our laundri work was easi we tie the week wash astern of
our boat and sail a quarter of a mile and the job was complet all
to the wring out if we threw the water on our head and gave them a
rub or so the white lather would pile up three inch high this water
is not good for bruis place and abras of the skin we had a
valuabl dog he had raw place on him he had more raw place on him
than sound one he was the rawest dog i almost ever saw he jump
overboard one day to get away from the fli but it was bad judgment
in his condit it would have been just as comfort to jump into the
fire

the alkali water nip him in all the raw place simultan and he
struck out for the shore with consider interest he yelp and
bark and howl as he wentand by the time he got to the shore there
was no bark to himfor he had bark the bark all out of his insid and
the alkali water had clean the bark all off his outsid and he
probabl wish he had never embark in ani such enterpris he ran
round and round in a circl and paw the earth and claw the air and
threw doubl somersault sometim backward and sometim forward in
the most extraordinari manner he was not a demonstr dog as a
general thing but rather of a grave and serious turn of mind and i
never saw him take so much interest in anyth befor he final
struck out over the mountain at a gait which we estim at about two
hundr and fifti mile an hour and he is go yet this was about
nine year ago we look for what is left of him along here everi day

a white man cannot drink the water of mono lake for it is near pure
lye it is said that the indian in the vicin drink it sometim
though it is not improb for they are among the purest liar i ever
saw there will be no addit charg for this joke except to
parti requir an explan of it this joke has receiv high
commend from some of the ablest mind of the age 

there are no fish in mono lakeno frog no snake no polliwig
noth in fact that goe to make life desir million of wild
duck and seagul swim about the surfac but no live thing exist
under the surfac except a white featheri sort of worm one half an inch
long which look like a bit of white thread fray out at the side if
you dip up a gallon of water you will get about fifteen thousand of
these they give to the water a sort of grayishwhit appear then
there is a fli which look someth like our hous fli these settl
on the beach to eat the worm that wash ashoreand ani time you can see
there a belt of fli an inch deep and six feet wide and this belt
extend clear around the lakea belt of fli one hundr mile long
if you throw a stone among them they swarm up so thick that they look
dens like a cloud you can hold them under water as long as you
pleasethey do not mind itthey are onli proud of it when you let
them go they pop up to the surfac as dri as a patent offic report and
walk off as unconcern as if they had been educ especi with a
view to afford instruct entertain to man in that particular
way provid leav noth to go by chanc all thing have their
use and their part and proper place in natur economi the duck eat
the fliesth fli eat the wormsth indian eat all threeth wild
cat eat the indiansth white folk eat the wild catsand thus all
thing are love

mono lake is a hundr mile in a straight line from the oceanand
between it and the ocean are one or two rang of mountainsyet
thousand of seagul go there everi season to lay their egg and rear
their young one would as soon expect to find seagul in kansa
and in this connect let us observ anoth instanc of natur
wisdom the island in the lake be mere huge mass of lava coat
over with ash and pumiceston and utter innoc of veget or
anyth that would burn and seagul egg be entir useless to
anybodi unless they be cook natur has provid an unfail spring of
boil water on the largest island and you can put your egg in there
and in four minut you can boil them as hard as ani statement i have
made dure the past fifteen year within ten feet of the boil
spring is a spring of pure cold water sweet and wholesom

so in that island you get your board and wash free of chargeand if
natur had gone further and furnish a nice american hotel clerk who was
crusti and disoblig and didnt know anyth about the time tabl
or the railroad routesoranythingand was proud of iti would not
wish for a more desir boardinghous

half a dozen littl mountain brook flow into mono lake but not a stream
of ani kind flow out of it it neither rise nor fall appar and
what it doe with it surplus water is a dark and bloodi mysteri

there are onli two season in the region round about mono lakeand these
are the break up of one winter and the begin of the next more
than onc in esmeralda i have seen a perfect blister morn open
up with the thermomet at nineti degre at eight oclock and seen the
snow fall fourteen inch deep and that same ident thermomet go
down to fortyfour degre under shelter befor nine oclock at night
under favor circumst it snow at least onc in everi singl
month in the year in the littl town of mono so uncertain is the
climat in summer that a ladi who goe out visit cannot hope to be
prepar for all emerg unless she take her fan under one arm and
her snow shoe under the other when they have a fourth of juli
process it general snow on them and they do say that as a general
thing when a man call for a brandi toddi there the bar keeper chop it
off with a hatchet and wrap it up in a paper like mapl sugar and it
is further report that the old soaker havent ani teethwor them out
eat gin cocktail and brandi punch i do not endors that
statementi simpli give it for what it is worthand it is worthwel
i should say million to ani man who can believ it without strain
himself but i do endors the snow on the fourth of julybecaus i know
that to be true




chapter xxxix

about seven oclock one blister hot morningfor it was now dead
summer timehigbi and i took the boat and start on a voyag of
discoveri to the two island we had often long to do this but had
been deter by the fear of storm for they were frequent and sever
enough to capsiz an ordinari rowboat like our without great
difficultyand onc capsiz death would ensu in spite of the bravest
swim for that venom water would eat a man eye out like fire
and burn him out insid too if he ship a sea it was call twelv
mile straight out to the islandsa long pull and a warm onebut the
morn was so quiet and sunni and the lake so smooth and glassi and
dead that we could not resist the temptat so we fill two larg
tin canteen with water sinc we were not acquaint with the local
of the spring said to exist on the larg island and start higbi
brawni muscl gave the boat good speed but by the time we reach our
destin we judg that we had pull nearer fifteen mile than
twelv

we land on the big island and went ashor we tri the water in the
canteen now and found that the sun had spoil it it was so brackish
that we could not drink it so we pour it out and began a search for
the springfor thirst augment fast as soon as it is appar that one
has no mean at hand of quench it the island was a long moder
high hill of ashesnoth but gray ash and pumiceston in which we
sunk to our knee at everi stepand all around the top was a forbid
wall of scorch and blast rock when we reach the top and got
within the wall we found simpli a shallow farreach basin carpet
with ash and here and there a patch of fine sand in place
picturesqu jet of steam shot up out of crevic give evid that
although this ancient crater had gone out of activ busi there was
still some fire left in it furnac close to one of these jet of
steam stood the onli tree on the islanda small pine of most grace
shape and most faultless symmetri it color was a brilliant green for
the steam drift unceas through it branch and kept them alway
moist it contrast strang enough did this vigor and beauti
outcast with it dead and dismal surround it was like a cheer
spirit in a mourn household

we hunt for the spring everywher travers the full length of the
island two or three mile and cross it twiceclimb ashhil
patient and then slide down the other side in a sit postur
plow up smother volum of gray dust but we found noth but
solitud ash and a heartbreak silenc final we notic that
the wind had risen and we forgot our thirst in a solicitud of greater
import for the lake be quiet we had not taken pain about
secur the boat we hurri back to a point overlook our land
place and thenbut mere word cannot describ our dismayth boat was
gone the chanc were that there was not anoth boat on the entir
lake the situat was not comfortablein truth to speak plain it
was fright we were prison on a desol island in aggrav
proxim to friend who were for the present helpless to aid us and
what was still more uncomfort was the reflect that we had neither
food nor water but present we sight the boat it was drift
along leisur about fifti yard from shore toss in a foami sea
it drift and continu to drift but at the same safe distanc from
land and we walk along abreast it and wait for fortun to favor us
at the end of an hour it approach a jut cape and higbi ran ahead
and post himself on the utmost verg and prepar for the assault if
we fail there there was no hope for us it was drive gradual
shoreward all the time now but whether it was drive fast enough to
make the connect or not was the moment question when it got
within thirti step of higbi i was so excit that i fanci i could
hear my own heart beat when a littl later it drag slowli along
and seem about to go by onli one littl yard out of reach it seem
as if my heart stood still and when it was exact abreast him and began
to widen away and he still stand like a watch statu i knew my
heart did stop but when he gave a great spring the next instant and
lit fair in the stern i discharg a warwhoop that woke the
solitud

but it dull my enthusiasm present when he told me he had not been
care whether the boat came within jump distanc or not so that it
pass within eight or ten yard of him for he had made up his mind to
shut his eye and mouth and swim that trifl distanc imbecil that i
was i had not thought of that it was onli a long swim that could be
fatal

the sea was run high and the storm increas it was grow late
toothre or four in the afternoon whether to ventur toward the
mainland or not was a question of some moment but we were so
distress by thirst that we decid to tri it and so higbi fell to work
and i took the steeringoar when we had pull a mile labori
we were evid in serious peril for the storm had great augment
the billow ran veri high and were cap with foam crest
the heaven were hung with black and the wind blew with great furi
we would have gone back now but we did not dare to turn the boat
around becaus as soon as she got in the trough of the sea she would
upset of cours our onli hope lay in keep her headon to the sea
it was hard work to do this she plung so and so beat and belabor
the billow with her rise and fall bow now and then one of
higbi oar would trip on the top of a wave and the other one would
snatch the boat half around in spite of my cumbersom steer apparatus
we were drench by the spray constant and the boat occasion
ship water by and by power as my comrad was his great
exert began to tell on him and he was anxious that i should chang
place with him till he could rest a littl but i told him this was
imposs for if the steer oar were drop a moment while we
chang the boat would slue around into the trough of the sea capsiz
and in less than five minut we would have a hundr gallon of
soapsud in us and be eaten up so quick that we could not even be
present at our own inquest

but thing cannot last alway just as the dark shut down we came
boom into port head on higbi drop his oar to hurrahi drop
mine to helpth sea gave the boat a twist and over she went

the agoni that alkali water inflict on bruis chafe and blister
hand is unspeak and noth but greas all over will modifi it
but we ate drank and slept well that night notwithstand

in speak of the peculiar of mono lake i ought to have mention
that at interv all around it shore stand picturesqu turretlook
mass and cluster of a whitish coarsegrain rock that resembl
inferior mortar dri hard and if one break off fragment of this rock
he will find perfect shape and thorough petrifi gull egg deepli
imbed in the mass how did they get there i simpli state the fact
for it is a factand leav the geolog reader to crack the nut at his
leisur and solv the problem after his own fashion

at the end of a week we adjourn to the sierra on a fish excurs
and spent sever day in camp under snowi castl peak and fish
success for trout in a bright miniatur lake whose surfac was
between ten and eleven thousand feet abov the level of the sea cool
ourselv dure the hot august noon by sit on snow bank ten feet
deep under whose shelter edg fine grass and dainti flower
flourish luxuri and at night entertain ourselv by almost
freez to death then we return to mono lake and find that the
cement excit was over for the present pack up and went back to
esmeralda mr ballou reconnoitr awhil and not like the prospect
set out alon for humboldt

about this time occur a littl incid which has alway had a sort of
interest to me from the fact that it came so near instigating my
funer at a time when an indian attack had been expect the citizen
hid their gunpowd where it would be safe and yet conveni to hand
when want a neighbor of our hid six can of rifl powder in the
bakeoven of an old discard cook stove which stood on the open
ground near a frame outhous or shed and from and after that day never
thought of it again we hire a halftam indian to do some wash for
us and he took up quarter under the shed with his tub the ancient
stove repos within six feet of him and befor his face final it
occur to him that hot water would be better than cold and he went out
and fire up under that forgotten powder magazin and set on a kettl of
water then he return to his tub

i enter the shed present and threw down some more cloth and was
about to speak to him when the stove blew up with a prodigi crash and
disappear leav not a splinter behind fragment of it fell in the
street full two hundr yard away near a third of the shed roof
over our head was destroy and one of the stove lid after cut a
small stanchion half in two in front of the indian whizz between us
and drove part through the weatherboard beyond i was as white as
a sheet and as weak as a kitten and speechless but the indian betray
no trepid no distress not even discomfort he simpli stop
wash lean forward and survey the clean blank ground a moment
and then remark

mph dam stove heap gone and resum his scrub as placid as if
it were an entir customari thing for a stove to do i will explain
that heap is injunenglish for veri much  the reader will perceiv
the exhaust express of it in the present instanc




chapter xl
i now come to a curious episodeth most curious i think that had yet
accent my sloth valueless heedless career out of a hillsid
toward the upper end of the town project a wall of reddish look
quartzcrop the expos comb of a silverbear ledg that
extend deep down into the earth of cours it was own by a compani
entitl the wide west  there was a shaft sixti or seventi feet deep
on the under side of the crop and everybodi was acquaint with the
rock that came from itand toler rich rock it was too but noth
extraordinari i will remark here that although to the inexperienc
stranger all the quartz of a particular district look about alik an
old resid of the camp can take a glanc at a mix pile of rock
separ the fragment and tell you which mine each came from as easili
as a confection can separ and classifi the various kind and
qualiti of candi in a mix heap of the articl

all at onc the town was thrown into a state of extraordinari excit
in mine parlanc the wide west had struck it rich  everybodi went to
see the new develop and for some day there was such a crowd of
peopl about the wide west shaft that a stranger would have suppos
there was a mass meet in session there no other topic was discuss
but the rich strike and nobodi thought or dream about anyth els
everi man brought away a specimen ground it up in a hand mortar wash
it out in his horn spoon and glare speechless upon the marvel
result it was not hard rock but black decompos stuff which could be
crumbl in the hand like a bake potato and when spread out on a paper
exhibit a thick sprinkl of gold and particl of native silver
higbi brought a hand to the cabin and when he had wash it out his
amaz was beyond descript wide west stock soar skyward it
was said that repeat offer had been made for it at a thousand dollar
a foot and prompt refus we have all had the bluesth mere
skybluesbut mine were indigo nowbecaus i did not own in the wide
west the world seem hollow to me and exist a grief i lost my
appetit and ceas to take an interest in anyth still i had to
stay and listen to other peopl rejoic becaus i had no money to
get out of the camp with

the wide west compani put a stop to the carri away of specimen  and
well they might for everi hand of the ore was worth a sun of some
consequ to show the exceed valu of the ore i will remark that
a sixteenhundredpound parcel of it was sold just as it lay at the
mouth of the shaft at one dollar a pound and the man who bought it
packed it on mule a hundr and fifti or two hundr mile over the
mountain to san francisco satisfi that it would yield at a rate that
would rich compens him for his troubl the wide west peopl also
command their foreman to refus ani but their own oper permiss
to enter the mine at ani time or for ani purpos i kept up my blue
medit and higbi kept up a deal of think too but of a
differ sort he puzzl over the rock  examin it with a glass
inspect it in differ light and from differ point of view and
after each experi deliv himself in soliloquy of one and the
same unvari opinion in the same unvari formula

it is not wide west rock 

he said onc or twice that he meant to have a look into the wide west
shaft if he got shot for it i was wretch and did not care whether he
got a look into it or not he fail that day and tri again at night
fail again got up at dawn and tri and fail again then he lay in
ambush in the sage brush hour after hour wait for the two or three
hand to adjourn to the shade of a boulder for dinner made a start onc
but was prematureon of the men came back for someth tri it
again but when almost at the mouth of the shaft anoth of the men rose
up from behind the boulder as if to reconnoitr and he drop on the
ground and lay quiet present he crawl on his hand and knee to the
mouth of the shaft gave a quick glanc around then seiz the rope and
slid down the shaft

he disappear in the gloom of a side drift just as a head appear in
the mouth of the shaft and somebodi shout hello which he did not
answer he was not disturb ani more an hour later he enter the
cabin hot red and readi to burst with smother excit and
exclaim in a stage whisper

i knew it we are rich it a blind lead 

i thought the veri earth reel under me doubtconvictiondoubt
againexultationhop amaz belief unbeliefeveri emot
imagin swept in wild process through my heart and brain and i
could not speak a word after a moment or two of this mental furi i
shook myself to right and said

there room to hurrah but what is the use it is a hundr time too
good to be true 

it a blind lead for a million hang wallfoot wallclay
casingseveryth complet  he swung his hat and gave three cheer
and i cast doubt to the wind and chime in with a will for i was worth
a million dollar and did not care whether school kept or not 

but perhap i ought to explain a blind lead is a lead or ledg that
doe not crop out abov the surfac a miner doe not know where to
look for such lead but they are often stumbl upon by accid in the
cours of drive a tunnel or sink a shaft higbi knew the wide west
rock perfect well and the more he had examin the new develop
the more he was satisfi that the ore could not have come from the wide
west vein and so had it occur to him alon of all the camp that
there was a blind lead down in the shaft and that even the wide west
peopl themselv did not suspect it he was right when he went down
the shaft he found that the blind lead held it independ way through
the wide west vein cut it diagon and that it was enclos in
it own welldefin casingrock and clay henc it was public
properti both lead be perfect well defin it was easi for ani
miner to see which one belong to the wide west and which did not

we thought it well to have a strong friend and therefor we brought the
foreman of the wide west to our cabin that night and reveal the great
surpris to him higbi said

we are go to take possess of this blind lead record it and
establish ownership and then forbid the wide west compani to take out
ani more of the rock you cannot help your compani in this matter
nobodi can help them i will go into the shaft with you and prove to
your entir satisfact that it is a blind lead now we propos to take
you in with us and claim the blind lead in our three name what do you
say 

what could a man say who had an opportun to simpli stretch forth his
hand and take possess of a fortun without risk of ani kind and
without wrong ani one or attach the least taint of dishonor to his
name he could onli say agre 

the notic was put up that night and duli spread upon the record
book befor ten oclock we claim two hundr feet eachsix hundr
feet in allth smallest and compactest organ in the district
and the easiest to manag

no one can be so thoughtless as to suppos that we slept that night
higbi and i went to bed at midnight but it was onli to lie broad awak

determin to go to work the next day about the middl of the
afternoon as i was come out of the post offic i met a mr gardin
who told me that capt john nye was lie danger ill at his place
the ninemil ranch and that he and his wife were not abl to give
him near as much care and attent as his case demand i said if he
would wait for me a moment i would go down and help in the sick room
i ran to the cabin to tell higbi he was not there but i left a note
on the tabl for him and a few minut later i left town in gardin
wagon




chapter xli

captain nye was veri ill inde with spasmod rheumat but the old
gentleman was himselfwhich is to say he was kindheart and agreeabl
when comfort but a singular violent wildcat when thing did not
go well he would be smile along pleasant enough when a sudden
spasm of his diseas would take him and he would go out of his smile into
a perfect furi he would groan and wail and howl with the anguish and
fill up the odd chink with the most elabor profan that strong
convict and a fine fanci could contriv with fair opportun he
could swear veri well and handl his adject with consider
judgment but when the spasm was on him it was pain to listen to him
he was so awkward howev i had seen him nurs a sick man himself and
put up patient with the inconveni of the situat and
consequ i was will that he should have full licens now that his
own turn had come he could not disturb me with all his rave and
rant for my mind had work on hand and it labor on dilig
night and day whether my hand were idl or employ i was alter
and amend the plan for my hous and think over the proprieti of
have the billardroom in the attic instead of on the same floor with
the diningroom also i was tri to decid between green and blue for
the upholsteri of the drawingroom for although my prefer was blue
i fear it was a color that would be too easili damag by dust and
sunlight likewis while i was content to put the coachman in a modest
liveri i was uncertain about a footmani need one and was even
resolv to have one but wish he could proper appear and perform his
function out of liveri for i somewhat dread so much show and yet
inasmuch as my late grandfath had had a coachman and such thing but
no liveri i felt rather drawn to beat him or beat his ghost at ani
rate i was also systemat the european trip and manag to get it
all laid out as to rout and length of time to be devot to it
everyth with one exceptionnam whether to cross the desert from
cairo to jerusalem per camel or go by sea to beirut and thenc down
through the countri per caravan meantim i was write to the friend
at home everi day instruct them concern all my plan and
intent and direct them to look up a handsom homestead for my
mother and agre upon a price for it against my come and also
direct them to sell my share of the tennesse land and tender the
proceed to the widow and orphan fund of the typograph union of
which i had long been a member in good stand this tennesse land
had been in the possess of the famili mani year and promis to
confer high fortun upon us some day it still promis it but in a less
violent way 

when i had been nurs the captain nine day he was somewhat better
but veri feebl dure the afternoon we lift him into a chair and
gave him an alcohol vapor bath and then set about put him on the
bed again we had to be exceed care for the least jar produc
pain gardin had his shoulder and i his leg in an unfortun
moment i stumbl and the patient fell heavili on the bed in an agoni of
tortur i never heard a man swear so in my life he rave like a
maniac and tri to snatch a revolv from the tablebut i got it
he order me out of the hous and swore a world of oath that he would
kill me wherev he caught me when he got on his feet again it was
simpli a pass furi and meant noth i knew he would forget it in
an hour and mayb be sorri for it too but it anger me a littl at
the moment so much so inde that i determin to go back to
esmeralda i thought he was abl to get along alon now sinc he was
on the war path i took supper and as soon as the moon rose began my
ninemil journey on foot

even millionair need no hors in those day for a mere ninemil
jaunt without baggag

as i rais the hill overlook the town it lack fifteen minut of
twelv i glanc at the hill over beyond the canyon and in the bright
moonlight saw what appear to be about half the popul of the
villag mass on and around the wide west crop my heart gave an
exult bound and i said to myself they have made a new strike
tonightand struck it richer than ever no doubt  i start over
there but gave it up i said the strick would keep and i had climb
hill enough for one night i went on down through the town and as i was
pass a littl german bakeri a woman ran out and beg me to come in
and help her she said her husband had a fit i went in and judg she
was righth appear to have a hundr of them compress into one
two german were there tri to hold him and not make much of a
success of it i ran up the street half a block or so and rout out a
sleep doctor brought him down half dress and we four wrestl with
the maniac and doctor drench and bled him for more than an hour
and the poor german woman did the cri he grew quiet now and the
doctor and i withdrew and left him to his friend

it was a littl after one oclock as i enter the cabin door tire
but jolli the dingi light of a tallow candl reveal higbi sit by
the pine tabl gaze stupid at my note which he held in his finger
and look pale old and haggard i halt and look at him he
look at me stolid i said

higbi whatwhat is it 

wer ruinedw didnt do the workth blind lead reloc 

it was enough i sat down sick grievedbrokenheart inde a
minut befor i was rich and brim of vaniti i was a pauper now and
veri meek we sat still an hour busi with thought busi with vain and
useless selfupbraid busi with whi didnt i do this and whi didnt
i do that  but neither spoke a word then we drop into mutual
explan and the mysteri was clear away it came out that higbi
had depend on me as i had on him and as both of us had on the
foreman the folli of it it was the first time that ever staid and
steadfast higbi had left an import matter to chanc or fail to be
true to his full share of a respons

but he had never seen my note till this moment and this moment was the
first time he had been in the cabin sinc the day he had seen me last
he also had left a note for me on that same fatal afternoonhad
ridden up on horseback and look through the window and be in a
hurri and not see me had toss the note into the cabin through a
broken pane here it was on the floor where it had remain
undisturb for nine day

dont fail to do the work befor the ten day expir w
has pass through and given me notic i am to join him at
mono lake and we shall go on from there tonight he say
he will find it this time sure cal 

w  meant whiteman of cours that thrice accurs cement 

that was the way of it an old miner like higbi could no more
withstand the fascin of a mysteri mine excit like this
cement foolish than he could refrain from eat when he was
famish higbi had been dream about the marvel cement for
month and now against his better judgment he had gone off and taken
the chances on my keep secur a mine worth a million undiscov
cement vein they had not been follow this time his ride out of
town in broad daylight was such a commonplac thing to do that it had
not attract ani attent he said they prosecut their search in the
fast of the mountain dure nine day without success they could
not find the cement then a ghast fear came over him that someth
might have happen to prevent the do of the necessari work to hold
the blind lead though inde he thought such a thing hard possibl
and forthwith he start home with all speed he would have reach
esmeralda in time but his hors broke down and he had to walk a great
part of the distanc and so it happen that as he came into esmeralda
by one road i enter it by anoth his was the superior energi
howev for he went straight to the wide west instead of turn asid
as i had doneand he arriv there about five or ten minut too late
the notice was alreadi up the relocation of our mine complet
beyond recal and the crowd rapid dispers he learn some fact
befor he left the ground the foreman had not been seen about the
street sinc the night we had locat the minea telegram had call
him to california on a matter of life and death it was said at ani
rate he had done no work and the watch eye of the communiti were
take note of the fact at midnight of this woful tenth day the ledg
would be relocat  and by eleven oclock the hill was black with men
prepar to do the reloc that was the crowd i had seen when i
fanci a new strike had been madeidiot that i was

we three had the same right to reloc the lead that other peopl had
provid we were quick enough  as midnight was announc fourteen men
duli arm and readi to back their proceed put up their notice and
proclaim their ownership of the blind lead under the new name of the
johnson  but a d allen our partner the foreman put in a sudden
appear about that time with a cock revolv in his hand and said
his name must be ad to the list or he would thin out the johnson
compani some  he was a man splendid determin fellow and known to
be as good as his word and therefor a compromis was effect they
put in his name for a hundr feet reserv to themselv the customari
two hundr feet each such was the histori of the night event as
higbi gather from a friend on the way home

higbi and i clear out on a new mine excit the next morn
glad to get away from the scene of our suffer and after a month or
two of hardship and disappoint return to esmeralda onc more
then we learn that the wide west and the johnson compani had
consolid that the stock thus unit compris five thousand feet
or share that the foreman apprehend tiresom litig and
consid such a huge concern unwieldi had sold his hundr feet for
nineti thousand dollar in gold and gone home to the state to enjoy it
if the stock was worth such a gallant figur with five thousand share
in the corpor it make me dizzi to think what it would have been
worth with onli our origin six hundr in it it was the differ
between six hundr men own a hous and five thousand own it we
would have been millionair if we had onli work with pick and spade
one littl day on our properti and so secur our ownership

it read like a wild fanci sketch but the evid of mani wit
and likewis that of the offici record of esmeralda district is
easili obtain in proof that it is a true histori i can alway have
it to say that i was absolut and unquestion worth a million
dollar onc for ten day

a year ago my esteem and in everi way estim old millionair
partner higbi wrote me from an obscur littl mine camp in
california that after nine or ten year of buffet and hard strive
he was at last in a posit where he could command twentyf hundr
dollar and said he meant to go into the fruit busi in a modest way
how such a thought would have insult him the night we lay in our cabin
plan european trip and brown stone hous on russian hill




chapter xlii

what to do next

it was a moment question i had gone out into the world to shift for
myself at the age of thirteen for my father had endors for friend
and although he left us a sumptuous legaci of pride in his fine virginian
stock and it nation distinct i present found that i could not
live on that alon without occasion bread to wash it down with i had
gain a livelihood in various vocat but had not dazzl anybodi
with my success still the list was befor me and the amplest liberti
in the matter of choos provid i want to workwhich i did not
after be so wealthi i had onc been a groceri clerk for one day
but had consum so much sugar in that time that i was reliev from
further duti by the proprietor said he want me outsid so that he
could have my custom i had studi law an entir week and then given
it up becaus it was so prosi and tiresom i had engag briefli in the
studi of blacksmith but wast so much time tri to fix the bellow
so that it would blow itself that the master turn me adrift in
disgrac and told me i would come to no good i had been a booksel
clerk for awhil but the custom bother me so much i could not read
with ani comfort and so the proprietor gave me a furlough and forgot to
put a limit to it i had clerk in a drug store part of a summer but
my prescript were unlucki and we appear to sell more stomach pump
than soda water so i had to go i had made of myself a toler
printer under the impress that i would be anoth franklin some day
but somehow had miss the connect thus far there was no berth open
in the esmeralda union and besid i had alway been such a slow
compositor that i look with envi upon the achiev of apprentic
of two year stand and when i took a take  foremen were in the
habit of suggest that it would be want some time dure the year 

i was a good averag st loui and new orlean pilot and by no mean
asham of my abil in that line wage were two hundr and fifti
dollar a month and no board to pay and i did long to stand behind a
wheel again and never roam ani morebut i had been make such an ass of
myself late in grandiloqu letter home about my blind lead and my
european excurs that i did what mani and mani a poor disappoint
miner had done befor said it is all over with me now and i will never
go back home to be pitiedand snub  i had been a privat secretari
a silver miner and a silver mill oper and amount to less than
noth in each and now

what to do next

i yield to higbi appeal and consent to tri the mine onc more
we climb far up on the mountain side and went to work on a littl
rubbishi claim of our that had a shaft on it eight feet deep higbi
descend into it and work brave with his pick till he had loosen
up a deal of rock and dirt and then i went down with a longhandl
shovel the most awkward invent yet contriv by man to throw it out
you must brace the shovel forward with the side of your knee till it is
full and then with a skil toss throw it backward over your left
shoulder i made the toss and land the mess just on the edg of the
shaft and it all came back on my head and down the back of my neck
i never said a word but climb out and walk home i inward
resolv that i would starv befor i would make a target of myself and
shoot rubbish at it with a longhandl shovel

i sat down in the cabin and gave myself up to solid miseryso to
speak now in pleasant day i had amus myself with write letter
to the chief paper of the territori the virginia daili territori
enterpris and had alway been surpris when they appear in print
my good opinion of the editor had steadili declin for it seem to me
that they might have found someth better to fill up with than my
literatur i had found a letter in the post offic as i came home from
the hill side and final i open it eureka i never did know what
eureka meant but it seem to be as proper a word to heav in as ani when
no other that sound pretti offer  it was a deliber offer to me of
twentyf dollar a week to come up to virginia and be citi editor of
the enterpris

i would have challeng the publish in the blind lead daysi want
to fall down and worship him now twentyf dollar a weekit look
like bloat luxurya fortun a sin and lavish wast of money
but my transport cool when i thought of my inexperi and consequ
unfit for the positionand straightway on top of this my long
array of failur rose up befor me yet if i refus this place i must
present becom depend upon somebodi for my bread a thing
necessarili distast to a man who had never experienc such a
humili sinc he was thirteen year old not much to be proud of
sinc it is so commonbut then it was all i had to be proud of so i
was scare into be a citi editor i would have declin otherwis
necess is the mother of take chanc  i do not doubt that if at
that time i had been offer a salari to translat the talmud from the
origin hebrew i would have acceptedalbeit with diffid and some
misgivingsand thrown as much varieti into it as i could for the money

i went up to virginia and enter upon my new vocat i was a rusti
look citi editor i am free to confesscoatless slouch hat blue
woolen shirt pantaloon stuf into boottop whisker half down to
the waist and the univers navi revolv slung to my belt but i
secur a more christian costum and discard the revolv

i had never had occas to kill anybodi nor ever felt a desir to do
so but had worn the thing in defer to popular sentiment and in
order that i might not by it absenc be offens conspicu and a
subject of remark but the other editor and all the printer carri
revolv i ask the chief editor and proprietor mr goodman i will
call him sinc it describ him as well as ani name could do for some
instruct with regard to my duti and he told me to go all over town
and ask all sort of peopl all sort of question make note of the
inform gain and write them out for public and he ad

never say we learn soandso or it is report  or it is rumor 
or we understand soandso but go to headquart and get the absolut
fact and then speak out and say it is soandso  otherwis peopl
will not put confid in your news unassail certain is the
thing that give a newspap the firmest and most valuabl reput 

it was the whole thing in a nutshel and to this day when i find a
report commenc his articl with we understand  i gather a
suspicion that he has not taken as much pain to inform himself as he
ought to have done i moral well but i did not alway practis well
when i was a citi editor i let fanci get the upper hand of fact too
often when there was a dearth of news i can never forget my first day
experi as a report i wander about town question everybodi
bore everybodi and find out that nobodi knew anyth at the end
of five hour my notebook was still barren i spoke to mr goodman he
said

dan use to make a good thing out of the hay wagon in a dri time when
there were no fire or inquest are there no hay wagon in from the
trucke if there are you might speak of the renew activ and all
that sort of thing in the hay busi you know

it isnt sensat or excit but it fill up and look busi
like 

i canvass the citi again and found one wretch old hay truck drag
in from the countri but i made affluent use of it i multipli it by
sixteen brought it into town from sixteen differ direct made
sixteen separ item out of it and got up such anoth sweat about hay
as virginia citi had never seen in the world befor

this was encourag two nonpareil column had to be fill and i was
get along present when thing began to look dismal again a
desperado kill a man in a saloon and joy return onc more i never
was so glad over ani mere trifl befor in my life i said to the
murder

sir you are a stranger to me but you have done me a kind this day
which i can never forget if whole year of gratitud can be to you ani
slight compens they shall be your i was in troubl and you have
reliev me nobli and at a time when all seem dark and drear count me
your friend from this time forth for i am not a man to forget a favor 

if i did not realli say that to him i at least felt a sort of itch
desir to do it i wrote up the murder with a hungri attent to
detail and when it was finish experienc but one regretnam
that they had not hang my benefactor on the spot so that i could work
him up too

next i discov some emigr wagon go into camp on the plaza and
found that they had late come through the hostil indian countri and
had fare rather rough i made the best of the item that the
circumst permit and felt that if i were not confin within
rigid limit by the presenc of the report of the other paper i could
add particular that would make the articl much more interest
howev i found one wagon that was go on to california and made some
judici inquiri of the proprietor when i learn through his short
and sur answer to my crossquest that he was certain go on
and would not be in the citi next day to make troubl i got ahead of the
other paper for i took down his list of name and ad his parti to
the kill and wound have more scope here i put this wagon through
an indian fight that to this day has no parallel in histori

my two column were fill when i read them over in the morn i felt
that i had found my legitim occup at last i reason within
myself that news and stir news too was what a paper need and i
felt that i was peculiar endow with the abil to furnish it
mr goodman said that i was as good a report as dan i desir no
higher commend with encourag like that i felt that i could
take my pen and murder all the immigr on the plain if need be and
the interest of the paper demand it




chapter xliii

howev as i grew better acquaint with the busi and learn the
run of the sourc of inform i ceas to requir the aid of fanci to
ani larg extent and becam abl to fill my column without diverg
notic from the domain of fact

i struck up friendship with the report of the other journal and we
swap regulars with each other and thus econom work regulars
are perman sourc of news like court bullion return cleanups
at the quartz mill and inquest inasmuch as everybodi went arm we
had an inquest about everi day and so this depart was natur set
down among the regular  we had live paper in those day my great
competitor among the report was bogg of the union he was an
excel report onc in three or four month he would get a littl
intox but as a general thing he was a wari and cautious drinker
although alway readi to tamper a littl with the enemi he had the
advantag of me in one thing he could get the month public school
report and i could not becaus the princip hate the enterpris
one snowi night when the report was due i start out sad wonder
how i was go to get it present a few step up the almost desert
street i stumbl on bogg and ask him where he was go

after the school report 

ill go along with you 

no sir ill excus you 

just as you say 

a saloonkeep boy pass by with a steam pitcher of hot punch and
bogg snuf the fragranc grate he gaze fond after the boy
and saw him start up the enterpris stair i said

i wish you could help me get that school busi but sinc you cant
i must run up to the union offic and see if i can get them to let me
have a proof of it after they have set it up though i dont begin to
suppos they will good night 

hold on a minut i dont mind get the report and sit around
with the boy a littl while you copi it if your will to drop down
to the princip with me 

now you talk like a ration be come along 

we plow a coupl of block through the snow got the report and
return to our offic it was a short document and soon copi
meantim bogg help himself to the punch i gave the manuscript back
to him and we start out to get an inquest for we heard pistol shot
near by we got the particular with littl loss of time for it was
onli an inferior sort of barroom murder and of littl interest to the
public and then we separ away at three oclock in the morn
when we had gone to press and were have a relax concert as usual
for some of the printer were good singer and other good perform on
the guitar and on that atroc the accordionth proprietor of the
union strode in and desir to know if anybodi had heard anyth of
bogg or the school report we state the case and all turn out to
help hunt for the delinqu we found him stand on a tabl in a
saloon with an old tin lantern in one hand and the school report in the
other harangu a gang of intox cornish miner on the iniqu of
squander the public money on educ when hundr and hundr of
honest hardwork men are liter starv for whiskey  riotous
applaus  he had been assist in a regal spree with those parti for
hour we drag him away and put him to bed

of cours there was no school report in the union and bogg held me
account though i was innoc of ani intent or desir to compass
it absenc from that paper and was as sorri as ani one that the
misfortun had occur

but we were perfect friend the day that the school report was next
due the proprietor of the genessee mine furnish us a buggi and ask
us to go down and write someth about the propertya veri common
request and one alway glad acced to when peopl furnish buggi
for we were as fond of pleasur excurs as other peopl in due time
we arriv at the minenoth but a hole in the ground nineti feet
deep and no way of get down into it but by hold on to a rope and
be lower with a windlass the workmen had just gone off somewher
to dinner i was not strong enough to lower bogg bulk so i took an
unlight candl in my teeth made a loop for my foot in the end of the
rope implor bogg not to go to sleep or let the windlass get the start
of him and then swung out over the shaft i reach the bottom muddi
and bruis about the elbow but safe i lit the candl made an
examin of the rock select some specimen and shout to bogg to
hoist away no answer present a head appear in the circl of
daylight away aloft and a voic came down

are you all set 

all sethoist away 

are you comfort 

perfect 

could you wait a littl 

oh certainlyno particular hurri 

wellgood by 

whi where are you go 

after the school report 

and he did i staid down there an hour and surpris the workmen when
they haul up and found a man on the rope instead of a bucket of rock
i walk home toofiv milesup hill we had no school report next
morn but the union had

six month after my entri into journal the grand flush times of
silverland began and they continu with unab splendor for three
year all difficulti about fill up the local department ceas
and the onli troubl now was how to make the lengthen column hold the

popul that america had ever produc the sidewalk swarm with
peopleto such an extent inde that it was general no easi matter
to stem the human tide the street themselv were just as crowd with
quartz wagon freight team and other vehicl the process was

an hour for an opportun to cross the princip street joy sat on

and the blast and pick and shovel went on without ceas night

the city of virginia roost royal midway up the steep side of mount
davidson seven thousand two hundr feet abov the level of the sea and
in the clear nevada atmospher was visibl from a distanc of fifti

and all day long half of this littl armi swarm the street like bee

blast down in the bowel of the earth under the offic

the mountain side was so steep that the entir town had a slant to it
like a roof each street was a terrac and from each to the next street
below the descent was forti or fifti feet the front of the hous were
level with the street they face but their rear first floor were
prop on lofti stilt a man could stand at a rear first floor window
of a c street hous and look down the chimney of the row of hous below
him face d street it was a labori climb in that thin atmospher
to ascend from d to a street and you were pant and out of breath when
you got there but you could turn around and go down again like a hous
afireso to speak the atmospher was so rarifi on account of the
great altitud that one blood lay near the surfac alway and the

chapter xliv

my salari was increas to forti dollar a week but i seldom drew it
i had plenti of other resourc and what were two broad twentydollar
gold piec to a man who had his pocket full of such and a cumbersom
abund of bright half dollar besid paper money has never come
into use on the pacif coast  report was lucrat and everi man
in the town was lavish with his money and his feet  the citi and all
the great mountain side were riddl with mine shaft there were more
mine than miner true not ten of these mine were yield rock worth
haul to a mill but everybodi said wait till the shaft get down
where the ledg come in solid and then you will see  so nobodi was
discourag these were near all wild cat mine and wholli
worthless but nobodi believ it then the ophir  the gould 
curri  the mexican  and other great mine on the comstock lead in
virginia and gold hill were turn out huge pile of rich rock everi
day and everi man believ that his littl wild cat claim was as good as
ani on the main lead and would infal be worth a thousand dollar a
foot when he got down where it came in solid  poor fellow he was
bless blind to the fact that he never would see that day so the
thousand wild cat shaft burrow deeper and deeper into the earth day by
day and all men were besid themselv with hope and happi how
they labor prophesi exult sure noth like it was ever seen
befor sinc the world began everi one of these wild cat minesnot
mine but hole in the ground over imaginari mineswa incorpor and
had handsom engrav stock and the stock was salabl too it was
bought and sold with a feverish avid in the board everi day you
could go up on the mountain side scratch around and find a ledg there
was no lack of them put up a notice with a grandiloqu name in it
start a shaft get your stock print and with noth whatev to prove
that your mine was worth a straw you could put your stock on the market
and sell out for hundr and even thousand of dollar to make money
and make it fast was as easi as it was to eat your dinner

everi man own feet in fifti differ wild cat mine and consid
his fortun made think of a citi with not one solitari poor man in it
one would suppos that when month after month went by and still not a
wild cat mine by wild cat i mean in general term ani claim not
locat on the mother vein i e the comstock yield a ton of rock
worth crush the peopl would begin to wonder if they were not put
too much faith in their prospect rich but there was not a thought
of such a thing they burrow away bought and sold and were happi

new claim were taken up daili and it was the friend custom to run
straight to the newspap offic give the report forti or fifti
feet  and get them to go and examin the mine and publish a notic of
it they did not care a fig what you said about the properti so you said
someth consequ we general said a word or two to the effect
that the indications were good or that the ledg was six feet wide 
or that the rock resembl the comstock and so it didbut as a
general thing the resembl was not startl enough to knock you
down if the rock was moder promis we follow the custom of
the countri use strong adject and froth at the mouth as if a veri
marvel in silver discoveri had transpir if the mine was a
developed one and had no pay ore to show and of cours it hadnt we
prais the tunnel said it was one of the most infatu tunnel in
the land drivel and drivel about the tunnel till we ran entir out
of ecstasiesbut never said a word about the rock we would squander
half a column of adul on a shaft or a new wire rope or a dress
pine windlass or a fascin forc pump and close with a burst of
admir of the gentleman and effici superintendent of the mine
but never utter a whisper about the rock and those peopl were alway
pleas alway satisfi occasion we patch up and varnish our
reput for discrimin and stern undevi accuraci by give
some old abandon claim a blast that ought to have made it dri bone
rattleand then somebodi would seiz it and sell it on the fleet
notorieti thus confer upon it

there was noth in the shape of a mine claim that was not salabl
we receiv present of feet everi day if we need a hundr dollar
or so we sold some if not we hoard it away satisfi that it would
ultim be worth a thousand dollar a foot i had a trunk about half
full of stock  when a claim made a stir in the market and went up to a
high figur i search through my pile to see if i had ani of it stock
and general found it

the price rose and fell constant but still a fall disturb us
littl becaus a thousand dollar a foot was our figur and so we were
content to let it fluctuat as much as it pleas till it reach it
my pile of stock was not all given to me by peopl who wish their
claim notic  at least half of it was given me by person who had no
thought of such a thing and look for noth more than a simpl verbal
thank you  and you were not even oblig by law to furnish that
if you are come up the street with a coupl of basket of appl in
your hand and you meet a friend you natur invit him to take a
few that describ the condit of thing in virginia in the flush
time  everi man had his pocket full of stock and it was the actual
custom of the countri to part with small quantiti of it to friend
without the ask

veri often it was a good idea to close the transact instant when a
man offer a stock present to a friend for the offer was onli good and
bind at that moment and if the price went to a high figur short
afterward the procrastin was a thing to be regret mr stewart
senat now from nevada one day told me he would give me twenti feet
of justis stock if i would walk over to his offic it was worth five
or ten dollar a foot i ask him to make the offer good for next day
as i was just go to dinner he said he would not be in town so i
risk it and took my dinner instead of the stock within the week the
price went up to seventi dollar and afterward to a hundr and fifti
but noth could make that man yield i suppos he sold that stock of
mine and place the guilti proceed in his own pocket mi reveng will
be found in the accompani portrait  i met three friend one
afternoon who said they had been buy overman stock at auction at
eight dollar a foot one said if i would come up to his offic he would
give me fifteen feet anoth said he would add fifteen the third said
he would do the same but i was go after an inquest and could not
stop a few week afterward they sold all their overman at six hundr
dollar a foot and generous came around to tell me about itand also
to urg me to accept of the next fortyf feet of it that peopl tri
to forc on me

these are actual fact and i could make the list a long one and still
confin myself strict to the truth mani a time friend gave us as
much as twentyf feet of stock that was sell at twentyf dollar
a foot and they thought no more of it than they would of offer a
guest a cigar these were flush times inde i thought they were
go to last alway but somehow i never was much of a prophet

to show what a wild spirit possess the mine brain of the communiti
i will remark that claims were actual located in excav for
cellar where the pick had expos what seem to be quartz veinsand
not cellar in the suburb either but in the veri heart of the citi
and forthwith stock would be issu and thrown on the market it was
small matter who the cellar belong toth ledge belong to the
finder and unless the unit state govern interf inasmuch as
the govern hold the primari right to mine of the nobl metal in
nevadaor at least did then it was consid to be his privileg to
work it imagin a stranger stake out a mine claim among the cost
shrubberi in your front yard and calm proceed to lay wast the
ground with pick and shovel and blast powder it has been often done
in california in the middl of one of the princip busi street of
virginia a man located a mine claim and began a shaft on it he
gave me a hundr feet of the stock and i sold it for a fine suit of
cloth becaus i was afraid somebodi would fall down the shaft and sue
for damag i own in anoth claim that was locat in the middl of
anoth street and to show how absurd peopl can be that east india
stock as it was call sold brisk although there was an ancient
tunnel run direct under the claim and ani man could go into it and
see that it did not cut a quartz ledg or anyth that remot
resembl one

one plan of acquir sudden wealth was to salt a wild cat claim and
sell out while the excit was up the process was simpl

the schemer locat a worthless ledg sunk a shaft on it bought a wagon
load of rich comstock ore dump a portion of it into the shaft and
pile the rest by it side abov ground then he show the properti to
a simpleton and sold it to him at a high figur of cours the wagon
load of rich ore was all that the victim ever got out of his purchas
a most remark case of salting was that of the north ophir 
it was claim that this vein was a remot extension of the origin
ophir  a valuabl mine on the comstock  for a few day everybodi was
talk about the rich develop in the north ophir it was said that
it yield perfect pure silver in small solid lump i went to the
place with the owner and found a shaft six or eight feet deep in the
bottom of which was a bad shatter vein of dull yellowish
unpromis rock one would as soon expect to find silver in a
grindston we got out a pan of the rubbish and wash it in a puddl
and sure enough among the sediment we found half a dozen black
bulletlook pellet of unimpeach native silver nobodi had ever
heard of such a thing befor scienc could not account for such a queer
novelti the stock rose to sixtyf dollar a foot and at this figur
the worldrenown tragedian mckean buchanan bought a command
interest and prepar to quit the stage onc moreh was alway do
that and then it transpir that the mine had been saltedand not in
ani hackney way either but in a singular bold barefac and
peculiar origin and outrag fashion on one of the lump of
native silver was discov the mint legend ted state of  and
then it was plain appar that the mine had been salted with melt
halfdollar the lump thus obtain had been blacken till they
resembl nativ silver and were then mix with the shatter rock in
the bottom of the shaft it is liter true of cours the price of
the stock at onc fell to noth and the tragedian was ruin but for
this calam we might have lost mckean buchanan from the stage

chapter xlvii

somebodi has said that in order to know a communiti one must observ the
style of it funer and know what manner of men they buri with most
ceremoni i cannot say which class we buri with most eclat in our
flush time  the distinguish public benefactor or the distinguish
roughposs the two chief grade or grand divis of societi
honor their illustri dead about equal and henc no doubt the
philosoph i have quot from would have need to see two
repres funer in virginia befor form his estim of the
peopl

there was a grand time over buck fanshaw when he die he was a
repres citizen he had kill his mannot in his own quarrel
it is true but in defenc of a stranger unfair beset by number
he had kept a sumptuous saloon he had been the proprietor of a dash
helpmeet whom he could have discard without the formal of a divorc
he had held a high posit in the fire depart and been a veri
warwick in polit when he die there was great lament throughout
the town but especi in the vast bottomstratum of societi

on the inquest it was shown that buck fanshaw in the delirium of a
wast typhoid fever had taken arsenic shot himself through the bodi
cut his throat and jump out of a fourstori window and broken his
neckand after due deliber the juri sad and tear but with
intellig unblind by it sorrow brought in a verdict of death bi
the visit of god  what could the world do without juri

prodigi prepar were made for the funer all the vehicl in
town were hire all the saloon put in mourn all the municip and
firecompani flag hung at halfmast and all the firemen order to
muster in uniform and bring their machin duli drape in black now
let us remark in parenthesisa all the peopl of the earth had
repres adventur in the silverland and as each adventur had
brought the slang of his nation or his local with him the combin
made the slang of nevada the richest and the most infinit vari and
copious that had ever exist anywher in the world perhap except in
the mine of california in the ear day  slang was the languag of
nevada it was hard to preach a sermon without it and be understood
such phrase as you bet  oh no i reckon not  no irish need
appli  and a hundr other becam so common as to fall from the lip
of a speaker unconsciouslyand veri often when they did not touch the
subject under discuss and consequ fail to mean anyth

after buck fanshaw inquest a meet of the shorthair brotherhood
was held for noth can be done on the pacif coast without a public
meet and an express of sentiment regret resolut were
pass and various committe appoint among other a committe of one
was deput to call on the minist a fragil gentl spiritu new
fledgl from an eastern theolog seminari and as yet unacquaint
with the way of the mine the committeeman scotty brigg made his
visit and in after day it was worth someth to hear the minist tell
about it scotti was a stalwart rough whose customari suit when on
weighti offici busi like committe work was a fire helmet
flame red flannel shirt patent leather belt with spanner and revolv
attach coat hung over arm and pant stuf into boot top
he form someth of a contrast to the pale theolog student it is
fair to say of scotti howev in pass that he had a warm heart and
a strong love for his friend and never enter into a quarrel when he
could reason keep out of it inde it was common said that
whenev one of scotti fight was investig it alway turn out
that it had origin been no affair of his but that out of nativ
goodhearted he had drop in of his own accord to help the man who
was get the worst of it he and buck fanshaw were bosom friend for
year and had often taken adventur potluck togeth on one
occas they had thrown off their coat and taken the weaker side in a
fight among stranger and after gain a hardearn victori turn
and found that the men they were help had desert earli and not onli
that but had stolen their coat and made off with them but to return
to scotti visit to the minist he was on a sorrow mission now
and his face was the pictur of woe be admit to the presenc he
sat down befor the clergyman place his firehat on an unfinish
manuscript sermon under the minist nose took from it a red silk

and said in lugubri tone

the obsequi were all that the boys could desir such a marvel of
funer pomp had never been seen in virginia the plume hears the
dirgebreath brass band the close mart of busi the flag
droop at half mast the long plod process of uniform secret
societi militari battalion and fire compani drape engin
carriag of offici and citizen in vehicl and on foot attract
multitud of spectat to the sidewalk roof and window and for
year afterward the degre of grandeur attain by ani civic display in
virginia was determin by comparison with buck fanshaw funer

scotti brigg as a pallbear and a mourner occupi a promin place
at the funer and when the sermon was finish and the last sentenc of
the prayer for the dead man soul ascend he respond in a low
voic but with feel

amen no irish need appli 

as the bulk of the respons was without appar relev it was
probabl noth more than a humbl tribut to the memori of the friend
that was gone for as scotti had onc said it was his word 

scotti brigg in after day achiev the distinct of becom the
onli convert to religion that was ever gather from the virginia rough
and it transpir that the man who had it in him to espous the quarrel
of the weak out of inborn nobil of spirit was no mean timber whereof
to construct a christian the make him one did not warp his generos
or diminish his courag on the contrari it gave intellig direct to
the one and a broader field to the other

if his sundayschool class progress faster than the other class was
it matter for wonder i think not he talk to his pioneer smallfri
in a languag they understood it was my larg privileg a month befor
he die to hear him tell the beauti stori of joseph and his brethren
to his class without look at the book  i leav it to the reader to
fanci what it was like as it fell riddl with slang from the lip of
that grave earnest teacher and was listen to by his littl learner
with a consum interest that show that they were as unconsci as he
was that ani violenc was be done to the sacr proprieti




chapter xlviii

the first twentysix grave in the virginia cemeteri were occupi by
murder men so everybodi said so everybodi believ and so they will
alway say and believ the reason whi there was so much slaughter
done was that in a new mine district the rough element predomin
and a person is not respect until he has kill his man  that was
the veri express use

if an unknown individu arriv they did not inquir if he was capabl
honest industri buthad he kill his man if he had not he
gravit to his natur and proper posit that of a man of small
consequ if he had the cordial of his recept was graduat
accord to the number of his dead it was tedious work struggl up
to a posit of influenc with bloodless hand but when a man came with
the blood of half a dozen men on his soul his worth was recogn at
onc and his acquaint sought

in nevada for a time the lawyer the editor the banker the chief
desperado the chief gambler and the saloon keeper occupi the same
level in societi and it was the highest the cheapest and easiest way
to becom an influenti man and be look up to by the communiti at
larg was to stand behind a bar wear a clusterdiamond pin and sell
whiski i am not sure but that the saloonkeep held a shade higher
rank than ani other member of societi his opinion had weight it was
his privileg to say how the elect should go no great movement
could succeed without the counten and direct of the
saloonkeep it was a high favor when the chief saloonkeep
consent to serv in the legislatur or the board of aldermen

youth ambit hard aspir so much to the honor of the law or the
armi and navi as to the digniti of proprietorship in a saloon

to be a saloonkeep and kill a man was to be illustri henc the
reader will not be surpris to learn that more than one man was kill
in nevada under hard the pretext of provoc so impati was the
slayer to achiev reput and throw off the gall sens of be
held in indiffer reput by his associ i knew two youth who
tri to kill their men for no other reasonand got kill themselv
for their pain there goe the man that kill bill adams was higher
prais and a sweeter sound in the ear of this sort of peopl than ani
other speech that admir lip could utter

the men who murder virginia origin twentysix cemeteryoccup
were never punish whi becaus alfr the great when he invent
trial by juri and knew that he had admir frame it to secur justic
in his age of the world was not awar that in the nineteenth centuri the
condit of thing would be so entir chang that unless he rose from
the grave and alter the juri plan to meet the emerg it would prove
the most ingeni and infal agenc for defeat justic that human
wisdom could contriv for how could he imagin that we simpleton would
go on use his juri plan after circumst had strip it of it
use ani more than he could imagin that we would go on use his
candleclock after we had invent chronomet in his day news could
not travel fast and henc he could easili find a juri of honest
intellig men who had not heard of the case they were call to tri
but in our day of telegraph and newspap his plan compel us to swear
in juri compos of fool and rascal becaus the system rigid
exclud honest men and men of brain

i rememb one of those sorrow farc in virginia which we call a
juri trial a note desperado kill mr b a good citizen in the most
wanton and coldblood way of cours the paper were full of it and
all men capabl of read read about it and of cours all men not
deaf and dumb and idiot talk about it a jurylist was made out
and mr b l a promin banker and a valu citizen was question
precis as he would have been question in ani court in america

have you heard of this homicid 

ye 

have you held convers upon the subject 

ye 

have you form or express opinion about it 

ye 

have you read the newspap account of it 

ye 

we do not want you 

a minist intellig esteem and great respect a merchant of
high charact and known probiti a mine superintend of intellig
and unblemish reput a quartz mill owner of excel stand
were all question in the same way and all set asid each said the
public talk and the newspap report had not so bias his mind but that
sworn testimoni would overthrow his previous form opinion and enabl
him to render a verdict without prejudic and in accord with the
fact but of cours such men could not be trust with the case
ignoramus alon could mete out unsulli justic

when the peremptori challeng were all exhaust a juri of twelv men
was impaneleda juri who swore they had neither heard read talk
about nor express an opinion concern a murder which the veri cattl
in the corral the indian in the sagebrush and the stone in the
street were cogniz of it was a juri compos of two desperado
two low beerhous politician three barkeep two ranchmen who could
not read and three dull stupid human donkey it actual came out
afterward that one of these latter thought that incest and arson were
the same thing

the verdict render by this juri was not guilti what els could one
expect

the juri system put a ban upon intellig and honesti and a premium
upon ignor stupid and perjuri it is a shame that we must
continu to use a worthless system becaus it was good a thousand year
ago in this age when a gentleman of high social stand intellig
and probiti swear that testimoni given under solemn oath will outweigh
with him street talk and newspap report base upon mere hearsay he
is worth a hundr jurymen who will swear to their own ignor and
stupid and justic would be far safer in his hand than in their
whi could not the juri law be so alter as to give men of brain and
honesti and equal chanc with fool and miscreant is it right to show
the present favorit to one class of men and inflict a disabl on
anoth in a land whose boast is that all it citizen are free and
equal i am a candid for the legislatur i desir to tamper with
the juri law i wish to so alter it as to put a premium on intellig
and charact and close the juri box against idiot blackleg and
peopl who do not read newspap but no doubt i shall be defeat
everi effort i make to save the countri miss fire 

my idea when i began this chapter was to say someth about
desperado in the flush times of nevada to attempt a portray of
that era and that land and leav out the blood and carnag would be
like portray mormondom and leav out polygami the desperado
stalk the street with a swagger grade accord to the number of his
homicid and a nod of recognit from him was suffici to make a
humbl admir happi for the rest of the day the defer that was
paid to a desperado of wide reput and who kept his privat
graveyard  as the phrase went was mark and cheer accord
when he move along the sidewalk in his excess longtail
frockcoat shini stumpto boot and with dainti littl slouch hat
tip over left eye the smallfri rough made room for his majesti
when he enter the restaur the waiter desert banker and
merchant to overwhelm him with obsequi servic when he shoulder
his way to a bar the shoulder parti wheel indign recogn
him and apolog

they got a look in return that froze their marrow and by that time a
curl and breastpin bar keeper was beam over the counter proud
of the establish acquaintanceship that permit such a familiar form
of speech as

howr ye billi old fel glad to see you whatll you taketh old
thing 

the old thing meant his customari drink of cours

the best known name in the territori of nevada were those belong to
these longtail hero of the revolv orat governor
capitalist and leader of the legislatur enjoy a degre of fame but
it seem local and meagr when contrast with the fame of such men as
sam brown jack william billi mulligan farmer peas sugarfoot mike
pock mark jake el dorado johnni jack mcnabb joe mcgee jack harri
sixfing pete etc etc there was a long list of them they were
brave reckless men and travel with their live in their hand to
give them their due they did their kill princip among themselv
and seldom molest peaceabl citizen for they consid it small
credit to add to their trophi so cheap a baubl as the death of a man
who was not on the shoot  as they phrase it they kill each other
on slight provoc and hope and expect to be kill themselv
for they held it almost shame to die otherwis than with their boot
on  as they express it

i rememb an instanc of a desperado contempt for such small game as a
privat citizen life i was take a late supper in a restaur one
night with two report and a littl printer namedbrown for
instanceani name will do present a stranger with a longtail coat
on came in and not notic brown hat which was lie in a chair sat
down on it littl brown sprang up and becam abus in a moment the
stranger smile smooth out the hat and offer it to brown with
profus apolog couch in caustic sarcasm and beg brown not to
destroy him brown threw off his coat and challeng the man to fight
abus him threaten him impeach his courag and urg and even
implor him to fight and in the meantim the smile stranger place
himself under our protect in mock distress but present he assum
a serious tone and said

veri well gentlemen if we must fight we must i suppos but dont
rush into danger and then say i gave you no warn i am more than a
match for all of you when i get start i will give you proof and
then if my friend here still insist i will tri to accommod him 

the tabl we were sit at was about five feet long and unusu
cumbersom and heavi he ask us to put our hand on the dish and
hold them in their place a momenton of them was a larg oval dish
with a port roast on it then he sat down tilt up one end of the
tabl set two of the leg on his knee took the end of the tabl
between his teeth took his hand away and pull down with his teeth
till the tabl came up to a level posit dish and all he said he
could lift a keg of nail with his teeth he pick up a common glass
tumbler and bit a semicircl out of it then he open his bosom and
show us a network of knife and bullet scar show us more on his
arm and face and said he believ he had bullet enough in his bodi to
make a pig of lead he was arm to the teeth he close with the
remark that he was mr  of caribooa celebr name whereat we shook
in our shoe i would publish the name but for the suspicion that he
might come and carv me he final inquir if brown still thirst for
blood brown turn the thing over in his mind a moment and thenask
him to supper

with the permiss of the reader i will group togeth in the next
chapter some sampl of life in our small mountain villag in the old
day of desperado i was there at the time the reader will observ
peculiar in our offici societi and he will observ also an
instanc of how in new countri murder breed murder

reederor at least what was left of himsurviv his wound two day
noth was ever done with gumbert

trial by juri is the palladium of our liberti i do not know what a
palladium is have never seen a palladium but it is a good thing no
doubt at ani rate not less than a hundr men have been murder in
nevadaperhap i would be within bound if i said three hundredand as

there howev four or five who had no money and no polit influenc
have been punish by imprisonmenton languish in prison as much as

may have been less

howev one propheci was verifi at ani rate it was assert by the
desperado that one of their brethren joe mcgee a special policeman
was known to be the conspir chosen by lot to assassin william
and they also assert that doom had been pronounc against mcgee and
that he would be assassin in exact the same manner that had been
adopt for the destruct of williamsa propheci which came true a
year later after twelv month of distress for mcgee saw a fanci
assassin in everi man that approach him he made the last of mani
effort to get out of the countri unwatch he went to carson and sat
down in a saloon to wait for the stageit would leav at four in the

it as an exampl of the whole he alter the charact of the brilliant
lawyer and made him a greatheart splendid fellow gave him fame and
rich and set his age at thirtythre year then he made the blond
discov through the help of the roscicrucian and the melodramat
miscreant that while the duke love her money ardent and want it he
secret felt a sort of lean toward the societyyoungladi stung to
the quick she tore her affect from him and bestow them with
tenfold power upon the lawyer who respond with consum zeal but
the parent would none of it what they want in the famili was a duke
and a duke they were determin to have though they confess that next
to the duke the lawyer had their prefer necessarili the blond now
went into a declin the parent were alarm they plead with her to
marri the duke but she steadfast refus and pine on then they
laid a plan they told her to wait a year and a day and if at the end
of that time she still felt that she could not marri the duke she might
marri the lawyer with their full consent the result was as they had
foreseen glad came again and the flush of return health then
the parent took the next step in their scheme they had the famili
physician recommend a long sea voyag and much land travel for the
thorough restor of the blond strength and they invit the duke
to be of the parti they judg that the duke constant presenc and
the lawyer protract absenc would do the restfor they did not
invit the lawyer

so they set sail in a steamer for americaand the third day out when
their seasick call truce and permit them to take their first
meal at the public tabl behold there sat the lawyer the duke and
parti made the best of an awkward situat the voyag progress and

chapter lii

sinc i desir in this chapter to say an instruct word or two about
the silver mine the reader may take this fair warn and skip if he
choos the year  was perhap the veri top blossom and culmin
of the flush time  virginia swarm with men and vehicl to that
degre that the place look like a veri hivethat is when one vision
could pierc through the thick fog of alkali dust that was general
blow in summer i will say concern this dust that if you drove
ten mile through it you and your hors would be coat with it a
sixteenth of an inch thick and present an outsid appear that was a
uniform pale yellow color and your buggi would have three inch of dust
in it thrown there by the wheel the delic scale use by the
assay were inclos in glass case intend to be airtight and yet
some of this dust was so impalp and so invis fine that it would
get in somehow and impair the accuraci of those scale

specul ran riot and yet there was a world of substanti busi
go on too all freight were brought over the mountain from
california  mile by packtrain part and part in huge wagon
drawn by such long mule team that each team amount to a process
and it did seem sometim that the grand combin process of anim
stretch unbroken from virginia to california it long rout was
traceabl clear across the desert of the territori by the writh
serpent of dust it lift up by these wagon freight over that
hundr and fifti mile were  a ton for small lot same price for
all express matter brought by stage and  a ton for full load
one virginia firm receiv one hundr ton of freight a month and paid
  a month freightag in the winter the freight were much higher
all the bullion was ship in bar by stage to san francisco a bar was
usual about twice the size of a pig of lead and contain from  
to   accord to the amount of gold mix with the silver and the
freight on it when the shipment was larg was one and a quarter per
cent of it intrins valu

so the freight on these bar probabl averag someth more than 
each small shipper paid two per cent there were three stage a day
each way and i have seen the outgo stage carri away a third of a
ton of bullion each and more than onc i saw them divid a twoton lot
and take it off howev these were extraordinari event
mr valentin well fargo agent has handl all the bullion ship
through the virginia offic for mani a month to his memorywhich is
excellentw are indebt for the follow exhibit of the compani
busi in the virginia offic sinc the first of januari  from
januari st to april st about   worth of bullion pass through
that offic dure the next quarter   next quarter  
next quarter   next quarter    and for the quarter
end on the th of last june about    thus in a year and a
half the virginia offic onli ship    in bullion dure the
year  they ship    so we perceiv the averag shipment
have more than doubl in the last six month this give us room to
promis for the virginia offic   a month for the year 
though perhap judg by the steadi increas in the busi we are
under estim somewhat this give us    for the year
gold hill and silver citi togeth can beat usw will give them
   to dayton empir citi ophir and carson citi we will
allow an aggreg of    which is not over the mark perhap
and may possibl be a littl under it to esmeralda we give   
to rees river and humboldt    which is liber now but may not
be befor the year is out so we prognost that the yield of bullion
this year will be about    place the number of mill in the
territori at one hundr this give to each the labor of produc
  in bullion dure the twelv month allow them to run three
hundr day in the year which none of them more than do this make
their work averag   a day say the mill averag twenti ton of
rock a day and this rock worth  as a general thing and you have the
actual work of our one hundr mill figur down to a spot  a
day each and    a year in the aggreg enterpris
a consider over estimatem t 

two ton of silver bullion would be in the neighborhood of forti bar
and the freight on it over   each coach alway carri a deal of
ordinari express matter besid and also from fifteen to twenti
passeng at from  to  a head with six stage go all the
time well fargo and co s virginia citi busi was import and
lucrat

all along under the centr of virginia and gold hill for a coupl of
mile ran the great comstock silver lodea vein of ore from fifti to
eighti feet thick between it solid wall of rocka vein as wide as some
of new york street i will remind the reader that in pennsylvania a
coal vein onli eight feet wide is consid ampl

virginia was a busi citi of street and hous abov ground under it
was anoth busi citi down in the bowel of the earth where a great
popul of men throng in and out among an intric maze of tunnel
and drift flit hither and thither under a wink sparkl of
light and over their head tower a vast web of interlock timber
that held the wall of the gut comstock apart these timber were as
larg as a man bodi and the framework stretch upward so far that no
eye could pierc to it top through the close gloom it was like
peer up through the cleanpick rib and bone of some coloss
skeleton imagin such a framework two mile long sixti feet wide and
higher than ani church spire in america imagin this state
latticework stretch down broadway from the st nichola to wall
street and a fourth of juli process reduc to pigmi parad on
top of it and flaunt their flag high abov the pinnacl of triniti
steepl one can imagin that but he cannot well imagin what that
forest of timber cost from the time they were fell in the pineri
beyond washo lake haul up and around mount davidson at atroci
rate of freightag then squar let down into the deep maw of the mine
and built up there twenti ampl fortun would not timber one of the
greatest of those silver mine the spanish proverb say it requir a
gold mine to run a silver one and it is true a beggar with a silver
mine is a pitiabl pauper inde if he cannot sell

i spoke of the underground virginia as a citi the gould and curri is
onli one singl mine under there among a great mani other yet the
gould and curri street of dismal drift and tunnel were five mile in
extent altogeth and it popul five hundr miner taken as a
whole the underground citi had some thirti mile of street and a
popul of five or six thousand in this present day some of those
popul are at work from twelv to sixteen hundr feet under
virginia and gold hill and the signalbel that tell them what the
superintend abov ground desir them to do are struck by telegraph as
we strike a fire alarm sometim men fall down a shaft there a
thousand feet deep in such case the usual plan is to hold an inquest

if you wish to visit one of those mine you may walk through a tunnel
about half a mile long if you prefer it or you may take the quicker plan
of shoot like a dart down a shaft on a small platform it is like
tumbl down through an empti steepl feet first when you reach the
bottom you take a candl and tramp through drift and tunnel where
throng of men are dig and blast you watch them send up tub full
of great lump of stonesilv ore you select choic specimen from the
mass as souvenir you admir the world of skeleton timber you
reflect frequent that you are buri under a mountain a thousand feet
below daylight be in the bottom of the mine you climb from gallery
to galleri  up endless ladder that stand straight up and down when
your leg fail you at last you lie down in a small boxcar in a cramp
incline like a halfupend sewer and are drag up to daylight
feel as if you are crawl through a coffin that has no end to it
arriv at the top you find a busi crowd of men receiv the ascend
car and tub and dump the ore from an elev into long row of
bin capabl of hold half a dozen ton each under the bin are row
of wagon load from chute and trapdoor in the bin and down the
long street is a process of these wagon wend toward the silver
mill with their rich freight it is all done  now and there you are
you need never go down again for you have seen it all if you have
forgotten the process of reduc the ore in the mill and make the
silver bar you can go back and find it again in my esmeralda chapter
if so dispos

of cours these mine cave in in place occasion and then it is
worth one while to take the risk of descend into them and observ
the crush power exert by the press weight of a settl mountain
i publish such an experi in the enterpris onc and from it i
will take an extract

an hour in the cave mine we journey down into the ophir mine
yesterday to see the earthquak we could not go down the deep
inclin becaus it still has a propens to cave in place
therefor we travel through the long tunnel which enter the hill
abov the ophir offic and then by mean of a seri of long
ladder climb away down from the first to the fourth galleri
travers a drift we came to the spanish line pass five set of
timber still uninjur and found the earthquak here was as
complet a chao as ever was seenvast mass of earth and
splinter and broken timber pile confus togeth with
scarc an apertur left larg enough for a cat to creep through
rubbish was still fall at interv from abov and one timber
which had brace other earlier in the day was now crush down out
of it former posit show that the cave and settl of the
tremend mass was still go on we were in that portion of the
ophir known as the north mine  return to the surfac we
enter a tunnel lead into the central for the purpos of
get into the main ophir descend a long inclin in this
tunnel we travers a drift or so and then went down a deep shaft
from whenc we proceed into the fifth galleri of the ophir from
a sidedrift we crawl through a small hole and got into the midst
of the earthquak againearth and broken timber mingl togeth
without regard to grace or symmetri a larg portion of the second
third and fourth galleri had cave in and gone to destructionth
two latter at seven oclock on the previous even

at the turntabl near the northern extrem of the fifth galleri
two big pile of rubbish had forc their way through from the fifth
galleri and from the look of the timber more was about to come
these beam are solideighteen inch squar first a great beam
is laid on the floor then upright one five feet high stand on
it support anoth horizont beam and so on squar abov
squar like the framework of a window the superincumb weight
was suffici to mash the end of those great upright beam fair
into the solid wood of the horizont one three inch compress
and bend the upright beam till it curv like a bow befor the
spanish cave in some of their twelveinch horizont timber were
compress in this way until they were onli five inch thick
imagin the power it must take to squeez a solid log togeth in
that way here also was a rang of timber for a distanc of
twenti feet tilt six inch out of the perpendicular by the
weight rest upon them from the cave galleri abov you could
hear thing crack and give way and it was not pleasant to know
that the world overhead was slowli and silent sink down upon
you the men down in the mine do not mind it howev

return along the fifth galleri we struck the safe part of the
ophir inclin and went down it to the sixth but we found ten
inch of water there and had to come back in repair the
damag done to the inclin the pump had to be stop for two
hour and in the meantim the water gain about a foot howev
the pump was at work again and the floodwat was decreas
we climb up to the fifth galleri again and sought a deep shaft
wherebi we might descend to anoth part of the sixth out of reach
of the water but suffer disappoint as the men had gone to
dinner and there was no one to man the windlass so have seen
the earthquak we climb out at the union inclin and tunnel and
adjourn all drip with candl greas and perspir to
lunch at the ophir offic

dure the great flush year of  nevada claim to have
produc    in bullionalmost if not quit a round
million to each thousand inhabit which is veri well
consid that she was without agricultur and manufactur
silver mine was her sole product industri sinc the abov was
in type i learn from an offici sourc that the abov figur is
too high and that the yield for  did not exceed    
howev the day for larg figur is approach the sutro tunnel
is to plow through the comstock lode from end to end at a depth of

absorb mani year and million of dollar in it complet but
it will earli yield money for that desir epoch will begin as
soon as it strike the first end of the vein the tunnel will be
some eight mile long and will develop astonish rich car
will carri the ore through the tunnel and dump it in the mill and
thus do away with the present cost system of doubl handl and

of cours there was a larg chines popul in virginiait is the
case with everi town and citi on the pacif coast they are a harmless
race when white men either let them alon or treat them no wors than
dog in fact they are almost entir harmless anyhow for they seldom
think of resent the vilest insult or the cruelest injuri they are
quiet peaceabl tractabl free from drunken and they are as
industri as the day is long a disord chinaman is rare and a
lazi one doe not exist so long as a chinaman has strength to use his
hand he need no support from anybodi white men often complain of want
of work but a chinaman offer no such complaint he alway manag to
find someth to do he is a great conveni to everybodyeven to
the worst class of white men for he bear the most of their sin
suffer fine for their petti theft imprison for their robberi
and death for their murder ani white man can swear a chinaman life
away in the court but no chinaman can testifi against a white man
our is the land of the freenobodi deni thatnobodi challeng it
mayb it is becaus we wont let other peopl testifi  as i write news
come that in broad daylight in san francisco some boy have stone an
inoffens chinaman to death and that although a larg crowd wit
the shame deed no one interf

there are seventi thousand and possibl one hundr thousand chinamen
on the pacif coast there were about a thousand in virginia they
were pen into a chines quartera thing which they do not
particular object to as they are fond of herd togeth their
build were of wood usual onli one stori high and set thick
togeth along street scarc wide enough for a wagon to pass through
their quarter was a littl remov from the rest of the town the chief
employ of chinamen in town is to wash cloth they alway send a
bill like this below pin to the cloth it is mere ceremoni for
it doe not enlighten the custom much their price for wash was
  per dozenrath cheaper than white peopl could afford to wash
for at that time a veri common sign on the chines hous was see
yup washer and ironer hong wo washer sam sing  ah hop wash 
the hous servant cook etc in california and nevada were chiefli
chinamen there were few white servant and no chinawomen so employ
chinamen make good hous servant be quick obedi patient quick
to learn and tireless industri they do not need to be taught a
thing twice as a general thing they are imit if a chinaman were
to see his master break up a centr tabl in a passion and kindl a
fire with it that chinaman would be like to resort to the furnitur
for fuel forev afterward

all chinamen can read write and cipher with easi facilityp but all
our pet voter could in california they rent littl patch of
ground and do a deal of garden they will rais surpris crop of
veget on a sand pile they wast noth what is rubbish to a
christian a chinaman care preserv and make use in one way or
anoth he gather up all the old oyster and sardin can that white
peopl throw away and procur market tin and solder from them by
melt he gather up old bone and turn them into manur
in california he get a live out of old mine claim that white men
have abandon as exhaust and worthlessand then the offic come
down on him onc a month with an exorbit swindl to which the
legislatur has given the broad general name of foreign mine tax
but it is usual inflict on no foreign but chinamen this swindl
has in some case been repeat onc or twice on the same victim in the
cours of the same monthbut the public treasuri was no addit
enrich by it probabl

chinamen hold their dead in great reverencethey worship their depart
ancestor in fact henc in china a man front yard back yard or
ani other part of his premis is made his famili buri ground in
order that he may visit the grave at ani and all time therefor that
huge empir is one mighti cemeteri it is ridg and wringl from it
centr to it circumfer with gravesand inasmuch as everi foot of
ground must be made to do it utmost in china lest the swarm
popul suffer for food the veri grave are cultiv and yield a
harvest custom hold this to be no dishonor to the dead sinc the
depart are held in such worship rever a chinaman cannot bear
that ani indign be offer the place where they sleep
mr burlingam said that herein lay china bitter opposit to
railroad a road could not be built anywher in the empir without
disturb the grave of their ancestor or friend

a chinaman hard believ he could enjoy the hereaft except his bodi
lay in his belov china also he desir to receiv himself after
death that worship with which he has honor his dead that preced him
therefor if he visit a foreign countri he make arrang to have
his bone return to china in case he die if he hire to go to a
foreign countri on a labor contract there is alway a stipul that
his bodi shall be taken back to china if he die if the govern sell
a gang of cooli to a foreign for the usual fiveyear term it is
specifi in the contract that their bodi shall be restor to china in
case of death on the pacif coast the chinamen all belong to one or
anoth of sever great compani or organ and these compani
keep track of their member regist their name and ship their bodi
home when they die the see yup compani is held to be the largest of
these the ning yeong compani is next and number eighteen thousand
member on the coast it headquart are at san francisco where it
has a cost templ sever great offic one of whom keep regal
state in seclus and cannot be approach by common human and a
numer priesthood in it i was shown a regist of it member with
the dead and the date of their shipment to china duli mark everi ship
that sail from san francisco carri away a heavi freight of chines
corpsesor did at least until the legislatur with an ingeni
refin of christian cruelti forbad the shipment as a neat
underhand way of deter chines immigr the bill was offer
whether it pass or not it is my impress that it pass there was
anoth billit becam a lawcompel everi incom chinaman to be
vaccin on the wharf and pay a duli appoint quack no decent doctor
would defil himself with such legal robberi ten dollar for it
as few import of chines would want to go to an expens like that the
lawmak thought this would be anoth heavi blow to chines
immigr

what the chines quarter of virginia was likeor inde what the
chines quarter of ani pacif coast town was and is likemay be
gather from this item which i print in the enterpris while report
for that paper

chinatown accompani by a fellow report we made a trip through
our chines quarter the other night the chines have built their
portion of the citi to suit themselv and as they keep neither
carriag nor wagon their street are not wide enough as a
general thing to admit of the passag of vehicl at ten oclock
at night the chinaman may be seen in all his glori in everi littl
coopedup dingi cavern of a hut faint with the odor of burn
joshlight and with noth to see the gloom by save the sick

fire and plaster it into the pipe much as a christian would fill a
hole with putti then he appli the bowl to the lamp and proceed
to smokeand the stew and fri of the drug and the gurgl of
the juic in the stem would wellnigh turn the stomach of a statu
john like it though it sooth him he take about two dozen
whiff and then roll over to dream heaven onli know what for we

porcelain he offer us a mess of birdsnest also small neat
sausag of which we could have swallow sever yard if we had chosen

and therefor refrain mr sing had in his store a thousand articl
of merchandis curious to behold imposs to imagin the use of and
beyond our abil to describ

his duck howev and his egg we could understand the former were
split open and flatten out like codfish and came from china in that
shape and the latter were plaster over with some kind of past which
kept them fresh and palat through the long voyag

we found mr hong wo no  chowchow street make up a lotteri
schemein fact we found a dozen other occupi in the same way in
various part of the quarter for about everi third chinaman run a
lotteri and the balanc of the tribe buck at it tom  who speak
faultless english and use to be chief and onli cook to the territori

i began to get tire of stay in one place so long

there was no longer satisfi varieti in go down to carson to report
the proceed of the legislatur onc a year and horserac and
pumpkinshow onc in three month they had got to rais pumpkin and
potato in washo valley and of cours one of the first achiev of
the legislatur was to institut a tenthousanddollar agricultur fair
to show off forti dollar worth of those pumpkin inhowev the
territori legislatur was usual spoken of as the asylum i want
to see san francisco i want to go somewher i wantedi did not
know what i want i had the spring fever and want a chang
princip no doubt besid a convent had frame a state
constitut nine men out of everi ten want an offic i believ that
these gentlemen would treat the moneyless and the irrespons among
the popul into adopt the constitut and thus wellnigh kill
the countri it could not well carri such a load as a state govern
sinc it had noth to tax that could stand a tax for undevelop mine
could not and there were not fifti develop one in the land there was
but littl realti to tax and it did seem as if nobodi was ever go to
think of the simpl salvat of inflict a money penalti on murder
i believ that a state govern would destroy the flush time  and i
want to get away i believ that the mine stock i had on hand
would soon be worth   and thought if they reach that befor the
constitut was adopt i would sell out and make myself secur from
the crash the chang of govern was go to bring i consid
  suffici to go home with decent though it was but a small
amount compar to what i had been expect to return with i felt
rather downheart about it but i tri to comfort myself with the
reflect that with such a sum i could not fall into want about this
time a schoolmat of mine whom i had not seen sinc boyhood came
tramp in on foot from rees river a veri allegori of poverti
the son of wealthi parent here he was in a strang land hungri
bootless mantl in an ancient horseblanket roof with a brimless
hat and so general and so extravag dilapid that he could have
taken the shine out of the prodig son himself  as he pleasant
remark

he want to borrow fortysix dollarstwentysix to take him to san
francisco and twenti for someth els to buy some soap with mayb
for he need it i found i had but littl more than the amount want
in my pocket so i step in and borrow fortysix dollar of a banker
on twenti day time without the formal of a note and gave it him
rather than walk half a block to the offic where i had some speci laid
up if anybodi had told me that it would take me two year to pay back
that fortysix dollar to the banker for i did not expect it of the
prodig and was not disappoint i would have felt injur and so
would the banker

i want a chang i want varieti of some kind it came mr goodman
went away for a week and left me the post of chief editor it destroy
me the first day i wrote my leader in the forenoon the second day
i had no subject and put it off till the afternoon the third day i put
it off till even and then copi an elabor editori out of the
american cyclopedia  that steadfast friend of the editor all over this
land the fourth day i fool around till midnight and then fell back
on the cyclopedia again the fifth day i cudgel my brain till
midnight and then kept the press wait while i pen some bitter
person on six differ peopl the sixth day i labor in
anguish till far into the night and brought forthnoth the paper
went to press without an editori the seventh day i resign on the
eighth mr goodman return and found six duel on his handsmi
person had born fruit

nobodi except he has tri it know what it is to be an editor it is
easi to scribbl local rubbish with the fact all befor you it is easi
to clip select from other paper it is easi to string out a
correspond from ani local but it is unspeak hardship to write
editori subject are the troubleth dreari lack of them i mean
everi day it is drag drag dragthink and worri and sufferal the
world is a dull blank and yet the editori column must be fill
onli give the editor a subject and his work is doneit is no troubl to
write it up but fanci how you would feel if you had to pump your brain
dri everi day in the week fiftytwo week in the year it make one low
spirit simpli to think of it the matter that each editor of a daili
paper in america write in the cours of a year would fill from four to
eight bulki volum like this book fanci what a librari an editor
work would make after twenti or thirti year servic yet peopl often
marvel that dicken scott bulwer duma etc have been abl to
produc so mani book if these author had wrought as volumin as
newspap editor do the result would be someth to marvel at inde
how editor can continu this tremend labor this exhaust
consumpt of brain fibr for their work is creativ and not a mere
mechan layingup of fact like report day after day and year
after year is incomprehens preacher take two month holiday in
midsumm for they find that to produc two sermon a week is wear
in the long run in truth it must be so and is so and therefor how
an editor can take from ten to twenti text and build upon them from ten
to twenti painstak editori a week and keep it up all the year
round is farther beyond comprehens than ever ever sinc i surviv
my week as editor i have found at least one pleasur in ani newspap
that come to my hand it is in admir the long column of editori
and wonder to myself how in the mischief he did it

mr goodman return reliev me of employ unless i chose to becom
a report again i could not do that i could not serv in the rank
after be general of the armi so i thought i would depart and go
abroad into the world somewher just at this junctur dan my
associ in the reportori depart told me casual that two
citizen had been tri to persuad him to go with them to new york and
aid in sell a rich silver mine which they had discov and secur
in a new mine district in our neighborhood he said they offer to
pay his expens and give him one third of the proceed of the sale
he had refus to go it was the veri opportun i want i abus
him for keep so quiet about it and not mention it sooner he said
it had not occur to him that i would like to go and so he had
recommend them to appli to marshal the report of the other paper
i ask dan if it was a good honest mine and no swindl he said the
men had shown him nine ton of the rock which they had got out to take
to new york and he could cheer say that he had seen but littl rock
in nevada that was richer and moreov he said that they had secur a
tract of valuabl timber and a millsit near the mine my first idea
was to kill dan but i chang my mind notwithstand i was so angri
for i thought mayb the chanc was not yet lost dan said it was by no
mean lost that the men were absent at the mine again and would not be
in virginia to leav for the east for some ten day that they had
request him to do the talk to marshal and he had promis that he
would either secur marshal or somebodi els for them by the time they
got back he would now say noth to anybodi till they return and
then fulfil his promis by furnish me to them

it was splendid i went to bed all on fire with excit for nobodi
had yet gone east to sell a nevada silver mine and the field was white
for the sickl i felt that such a mine as the one describ by dan
would bring a princ sum in new york and sell without delay or
difficulti i could not sleep my fanci so riot through it castl in
the air it was the blind lead come again

next day i got away on the coach with the usual eclat attend
departur of old citizen for if you have onli half a dozen friend
out there they will make nois for a hundr rather than let you seem to
go away neglect and unregrettedand dan promis to keep strict watch
for the men that had the mine to sell

the trip was signal but by one littl incid and that occur
just as we were about to start a veri seedi look vagabond passeng
got out of the stage a moment to wait till the usual ballast of silver
brick was thrown in he was stand on the pavement when an awkward
express employe carri a brick weigh a hundr pound stumbl
and let it fall on the bummer foot he instant drop on the ground
and began to howl in the most heartbreak way a sympath crowd
gather around and were go to pull his boot off but he scream
louder than ever and they desist then he fell to gasp and between
the gasp ejacul brandi for heaven sake brandi  they pour
half a pint down him and it wonder restor and comfort him
then he beg the peopl to assist him to the stage which was done
the express peopl urg him to have a doctor at their expens but he
declin and said that if he onli had a littl brandi to take along with
him to sooth his paroxym of pain when they came on he would be
grate and content he was quick suppli with two bottl and we
drove off he was so smile and happi after that that i could not
refrain from ask him how he could possibl be so comfort with a
crush foot

well  said he i hadnt had a drink for twelv hour and hadnt a
cent to my name i was most perishingand so when that duffer drop
that hundredpound on my foot i see my chanc got a cork leg you
know  and he pull up his pantaloon and prove it

he was as drunk as a lord all day long and full of chuckl over his
time ingenu

one drunken man necessarili remind one of anoth i onc heard a
gentleman tell about an incid which he wit in a californian
barroom he entitl it ye modest man taketh a drink  it was noth
but a bit of act but it seem to me a perfect render and worthi
of toodl himself the modest man toler far gone with beer and
other matter enter a saloon twentyf cent is the price for
anyth and everyth and speci the onli money use and lay down a
half dollar call for whiskey and drink it the barkeep make chang
and lay the quarter in a wet place on the counter the modest man
fumbl at it with nerveless finger but it slip and the water hold
it he contempl it and tri again same result observ that
peopl are interest in what he is at blush fumbl at the quarter
againblushesput his forefing care slowli down to make sure
of his aimpush the coin toward the barkeep and say with a sigh

gimm a cigar 

natur anoth gentleman present told about anoth drunken man he
said he reel toward home late at night made a mistak and enter the
wrong gate thought he saw a dog on the stoop and it wasan iron one

he stop and consid wonder if it was a danger dog ventur
to say be hic begon  no effect then he approach warili and
adopt concili purs up his lip and tri to whistl but
fail still approach say poor dog doggi doggi doggi poor
doggydog  got up on the stoop still pet with fond name till
master of the advantag then exclaim leav you thief plant a
vindict kick in his rib and went headoverheel overboard of

rock at all right but let him keep him at homenot have him layin
round promiscu where ic where peopl liabl to stumbl over him
when they aint noticin 

it was not without regret that i took a last look at the tini flag it
was thirtyf feet long and ten feet wide flutter like a ladi
handkerchief from the topmost peak of mount davidson two thousand feet
abov virginia roof and felt that doubtless i was bid a perman
farewel to a citi which had afford me the most vigor enjoy of
life i had ever experienc and this remind me of an incid which
the dullest memori virginia could boast at the time it happen must
vivid recal at time till it possessor die late one summer
afternoon we had a rain shower

that was astonish enough in itself to set the whole town buzz
for it onli rain dure a week or two week in the winter in nevada
and even then not enough at a time to make it worth while for ani
merchant to keep umbrella for sale but the rain was not the chief
wonder it onli last five or ten minut while the peopl were still
talk about it all the heaven gather to themselv a dens black
as of midnight all the vast eastern front of mount davidson
overlook the citi put on such a funer gloom that onli the
near and solid of the mountain made it outlin even faint
distinguish from the dead black of the heaven they rest
against this unaccustom sight turn all eye toward the mountain
and as they look a littl tongu of rich golden flame was seen wave
and quiver in the heart of the midnight away up on the extrem
summit in a few minut the street were pack with peopl gaze with
hard an utter word at the one brilliant mote in the brood world
of dark it flick like a candleflam and look no larger but
with such a background it was wonder bright small as it was it
was the flag though no one suspect it at first it seem so like a
supernatur visitor of some kinda mysteri messeng of good
tide some were fain to believ it was the nation emblem
transfigur by the depart ray of a sun that was entir pall from
view and on no other object did the glori fall in all the broad
panorama of mountain rang and desert not even upon the staff of the
flagfor that a needl in the distanc at ani time was now untouch
by the light and undistinguish in the gloom for a whole hour the
weird visitor wink and burn in it lofti solitud and still the
thousand of uplift eye watch it with fascin interest how the
peopl were wrought up the superstit grew apac that this was a
mystic courier come with great news from the warth poetri of the idea
excus and commend itand on it spread from heart to heart from
lip to lip and from street to street till there was a general impuls to
have out the militari and welcom the bright waif with a salvo of
artilleri

and all that time one sore tri man the telegraph oper sworn to
offici secreci had to lock his lip and chain his tongu with a
silenc that was like to rend them for he and he onli of all the
specul multitud knew the great thing this sink sun had seen
that day in the eastvicksburg fallen and the union arm victori at
gettysburg

but for the journalist monopoli that forbad the slightest reveal
of eastern news till a day after it public in the california
paper the glorifi flag on mount davidson would have been salut and
resalut that memor even as long as there was a charg of
powder to thunder with the citi would have been illumin and everi
man that had ani respect for himself would have got drunk as was the
custom of the countri on all occas of public moment even at this
distant day i cannot think of this needless mar suprem opportun
without regret what a time we might have had




chapter lvi

we rumbl over the plain and valley climb the sierra to the
cloud and look down upon summerclad california and i will remark
here in pass that all sceneri in california requir distanc to
give it it highest charm the mountain are impos in their sublim
and their majesti of form and altitud from ani point of viewbut one
must have distanc to soften their rugged and enrich their tint
a californian forest is best at a littl distanc for there is a sad
poverti of varieti in speci the tree be chiefli of one monoton
familyredwood pine spruce firand so at a near view there is a
wearisom same of attitud in their rigid arm stretch down ward
and outward in one continu and reiter appeal to all men to sh
dont say a word you might disturb somebodi  close at hand too
there is a reliefless and relentless smell of pitch and turpentin there
is a ceaseless melancholi in their sigh and complain foliag one
walk over a soundless carpet of beaten yellow bark and dead spine of
the foliag till he feel like a wander spirit bereft of a footfal
he tire of the endless tuft of needl and yearn for substanti
shape leav he look for moss and grass to loll upon and find none
for where there is no bark there is nake clay and dirt enemi to
pensiv muse and clean apparel often a grassi plain in california is
what it should be but often too it is best contempl at a distanc
becaus although it grass blade are tall they stand up vindict
straight and selfsuffici and are unsoci wide apart with
uncom spot of barren sand between

one of the queerest thing i know of is to hear tourist from the
states go into ecstasi over the loveli of everbloom
california  and they alway do go into that sort of ecstasi but
perhap they would modifi them if they knew how old californian with
the memori full upon them of the dustcov and question summer
green of californian verdur  stand astonish and fill with
worship admir in the presenc of the lavish rich the
brilliant green the infinit fresh the spendthrift varieti of form
and speci and foliag that make an eastern landscap a vision of
paradis itself the idea of a man fall into raptur over grave and
sombr california when that man has seen new england meadowexpans
and her mapl oak and cathedralwindow elm deck in summer attir
or the opalin splendor of autumn descend upon her forest come

san francisco a truli fascin citi to live in is state and
handsom at a fair distanc but close at hand one note that the
architectur is most oldfashion mani street are made up of
decay smokegrim wooden hous and the barren sandhil toward
the outskirt obtrud themselv too promin even the kind
climat is sometim pleasant when read about than person
experienc for a love cloudless sky wear out it welcom by and by
and then when the long for rain doe come it stay even the play
earthquak is better contempl at a dis

howev there are vari opinion about that

the climat of san francisco is mild and singular equabl the
thermomet stand at about seventi degre the year round it hard
chang at all you sleep under one or two light blanket summer and
winter and never use a mosquito bar nobodi ever wear summer cloth
you wear black broadclothif you have itin august and januari just
the same it is no colder and no warmer in the one month than the
other you do not use overcoat and you do not use fan it is as
pleasant a climat as could well be contriv take it all around and is
doubtless the most unvari in the whole world the wind blow there a
good deal in the summer month but then you can go over to oakland if
you choosethre or four mile awayit doe not blow there it has
onli snow twice in san francisco in nineteen year and then it onli
remain on the ground long enough to astonish the children and set them
to wonder what the featheri stuff was

dure eight month of the year straight along the sky are bright and
cloudless and never a drop of rain fall but when the other four
month come along you will need to go and steal an umbrella becaus
you will requir it not just one day but one hundr and twenti day
in hard vari success when you want to go visit or attend
church or the theatr you never look up at the cloud to see whether it
is like to rain or notyou look at the almanac if it is winter it
will rainand if it is summer it wont rain and you cannot help it
you never need a lightningrod becaus it never thunder and it never
lighten and after you have listen for six or eight week everi
night to the dismal monotoni of those quiet rain you will wish in your
heart the thunder would leap and crash and roar along those drowsi sky
onc and make everyth aliveyou will wish the prison lightn
would cleav the dull firmament asund and light it with a blind
glare for one littl instant you would give anyth to hear the old
familiar thunder again and see the lightn strike somebodi and along
in the summer when you have suffer about four month of lustrous
pitiless sunshin you are readi to go down on your knee and plead for
rainhailsnowthund and lightninganyth to break the monotoni

the bubbl scarc left a microscop moistur behind it i was an
earli beggar and a thorough one my hoard stock were not worth the

went to work i was not entir broken in spirit for i was build
confid on the sale of the silver mine in the east but i could not
hear from dan my letter miscarri or were not answer

under way

i comfort myself with the thought that may be the specul would
amount to nothingpoor comfort at bestand then went back to my
slaveri resolv to put up with my thirtyf dollar a week and forget
all about it

a month afterward i enjoy my first earthquak it was one which was
long call the great earthquak and is doubtless so distinguish
till this day it was just after noon on a bright octob day i was
come down third street the onli object in motion anywher in sight
in that thick built and popul quarter were a man in a buggi behind
me and a street car wend slowli up the cross street otherwis all
was solitud and a sabbath still as i turn the corner around a
frame hous there was a great rattl and jar and it occur to me that
here was an item no doubt a fight in that hous befor i could turn
and seek the door there came a realli terrif shock the ground seem
to roll under me in wave interrupt by a violent joggl up and down
and there was a heavi grind nois as of brick hous rub togeth
i fell up against the frame hous and hurt my elbow i knew what it was
now and from mere reportori instinct noth els took out my watch
and note the time of day at that moment a third and still sever shock
came and as i reel about on the pavement tri to keep my foot
i saw a sight the entir front of a tall fourstori brick build in
third street sprung outward like a door and fell sprawl across the
street rais a dust like a great volum of smoke and here came the
buggyoverboard went the man and in less time than i can tell it the
vehicl was distribut in small fragment along three hundr yard of
street

one could have fanci that somebodi had fire a charg of chairround
and rag down the thoroughfar the street car had stop the hors
were rear and plung the passeng were pour out at both end
and one fat man had crash half way through a glass window on one side
of the car got wedg fast and was squirm and scream like an
impal madman everi door of everi hous as far as the eye could
reach was vomit a stream of human be and almost befor one could
execut a wink and begin anoth there was a mass multitud of peopl
stretch in endless process down everi street my posit command
never was solemn solitud turn into teem life quicker

of the wonder wrought by the great earthquak  these were all that
came under my eye but the trick it did elsewher and far and wide
over the town made toothsom gossip for nine day

the destruct of properti was triflingth injuri to it was
widespread and somewhat serious

the curiosities of the earthquak were simpli endless gentlemen and
ladi who were sick or were take a siesta or had dissip till a
late hour and were make up lost sleep throng into the public street
in all sort of queer apparel and some without ani at all one woman
who had been wash a nake child ran down the street hold it by the
ankl as if it were a dress turkey promin citizen who were
suppos to keep the sabbath strict rush out of saloon in their
shirtsleev with billiard cue in their hand dozen of men with
neck swath in napkin rush from barbershop lather to the eye
or with one cheek clean shave and the other still bear a hairi
stubbl hors broke from stabl and a frighten dog rush up a
short attic ladder and out on to a roof and when his scare was over had
not the nerv to go down again the same way he had gone up

a promin editor flew down stair in the princip hotel with noth
on but one brief undergarmentmet a chambermaid and exclaim

oh what shall i do where shall i go 

she respond with naiv seren

if you have no choic you might tri a clothingstor 

a certain foreign consul ladi was the acknowledg leader of fashion
and everi time she appear in anyth new or extraordinari the ladi
in the vicin made a raid on their husband purs and array
themselv similar one man who had suffer consider and growl
accord was stand at the window when the shock came and the
next instant the consul wife just out of the bath fled by with no
other apolog for cloth thana bathtowel the suffer rose
superior to the terror of the earthquak and said to his wife

now that is someth like get out your towel my dear 

the plaster that fell from ceil in san francisco that day would
have cover sever acr of ground for some day afterward group of
eye and point men stood about mani a build look at long
zigzag crack that extend from the eav to the ground four feet of
the top of three chimney on one hous were broken squar off and turn
around in such a way as to complet stop the draft

a crack a hundr feet long gape open six inch wide in the middl of
one street and then shut togeth again with such forc as to ridg up
the meet earth like a slender grave a ladi sit in her rock
and quak parlor saw the wall part at the ceil open and shut
twice like a mouth and thendrop the end of a brick on the floor like a
tooth she was a woman easili disgust with foolish and she aros
and went out of there one ladi who was come down stair was
astonish to see a bronz hercul lean forward on it pedest as if to
strike her with it club they both reach the bottom of the flight at
the same time the woman insens from the fright her child born
some littl time afterward was clubfoot howeveron second
thought if the reader see ani coincid in this he must do it at
his own risk

the first shock brought down two or three huge organpip in one of the
church the minist with uplift hand was just close the
servic he glanc up hesit and said

howev we will omit the benedict and the next instant there was
a vacanc in the atmospher where he had stood

after the first shock an oakland minist said

keep your seat there is no better place to die than this

and ad after the third

but outsid is good enough  he then skip out at the back door

such anoth destruct of mantel ornament and toilet bottl as the
earthquak creat san francisco never saw befor there was hard a
girl or a matron in the citi but suffer loss of this kind suspend
pictur were thrown down but often still by a curious freak of the
earthquak humor they were whirl complet around with their face
to the wall there was great differ of opinion at first as to the
cours or direct the earthquak travel but water that splash out
of various tank and bucket settl that thousand of peopl were made
so seasick by the roll and pitch of floor and street that they
were weak and bedridden for hour and some few for even day
afterward hard an individu escap nausea entir

the queer earthquakeepisod that form the stapl of san francisco
gossip for the next week would fill a much larger book than this and so
i will diverg from the subject

by and by in the due cours of thing i pick up a copi of the
enterpris one day and fell under this cruel blow

nevada mine in new york g m marshal sheba hur and amo h
rose who left san francisco last juli for new york citi with ore
from mine in pine wood district humboldt counti and on the rees
river rang have dispos of a mine contain six thousand feet
and call the pine mountain consolid for the sum of
   the stamp on the deed which is now on it way to
humboldt counti from new york for record amount to  
which is said to be the largest amount of stamp ever place on one
document a work capit of    has been paid into the
treasuri and machineri has alreadi been purchas for a larg
quartz mill which will be put up as soon as possibl the stock in
this compani is all full paid and entir unassess the ore
of the mine in this district somewhat resembl those of the sheba
mine in humboldt sheba hurst the discover of the mine with
his friend corral all the best lead and all the land and timber
they desir befor make public their whereabout ore from

wood and water in the district we are glad to know that new york
capit has been enlist in the develop of the mine of this
region have seen the ore and assay we are satisfi that the

onc more nativ imbecil had carri the day and i had lost a
million it was the blind lead over again

let us not dwell on this miser matter if i were invent these
thing i could be wonder humor over them but they are too true
to be talk of with hearti leviti even at this distant day true and
yet not exact as given in the abov figur possibl i saw marshal
month afterward and although he had plenti of money he did not claim to
have captur an entir million in fact i gather that he had not then
receiv   beyond that figur his fortun appear to consist of
uncertain vast expect rather than prodigi certainti howev
when the abov item appear in print i put full faith in it and
incontin wilt and went to seed under it  suffic it that i so
lost heart and so yield myself up to repin and sigh and
foolish regret that i neglect my duti and becam about worthless
as a report for a brisk newspap and at last one of the proprietor
took me asid with a chariti i still rememb with consider respect
and gave me an opportun to resign my berth and so save myself the
disgrac of a dismiss

wander that were but slink away from cheer and light i
slunk to my bed i felt meaner and lowlier and more despic than the
worm dure all this time i had but one piec of moneya silver ten
cent pieceand i held to it and would not spend it on ani account lest
the conscious come strong upon me that i was entir penniless
might suggest suicid i had pawn everi thing but the cloth i had

that i yearn toward him as a brother i want to claim kinship with
him and go about and enjoy our wretched togeth the draw toward
each other must have been mutual at ani rate we got to fall togeth
often though still seem by accid and although we did not

enjoy our dumb companionship

final we spoke and were insepar after that for our woe were
ident almost he had been a report too and lost his berth and
this was his experi as near as i can recollect it after lose
his berth he had gone down down down with never a halt from a
board hous on russian hill to a board hous in kearney street
from thenc to dupont from thenc to a low sailor den and from thenc
to lodg in good box and empti hogshead near the wharv then
for a while he had gain a meagr live by sew up burst sack of
grain on the pier when that fail he had found food here and there as
chanc threw it in his way he had ceas to show his face in daylight
now for a report know everybodi rich and poor high and low and
cannot well avoid familiar face in the broad light of day

this mendic blucheri call him that for conveniencewa a splendid
creatur he was full of hope pluck and philosophi he was well read
and a man of cultiv tast he had a bright wit and was a master of
satir his kindli and his generous spirit made him royal in my eye
and chang his curbston seat to a throne and his damag hat to a
crown

he had an adventur onc which stick fast in my memori as the most
pleasant grotesqu that ever touch my sympathi he had been
without a penni for two month he had shirk about obscur street
among friend dim light till the thing had becom second natur to
him but at last he was driven abroad in daylight the caus was
suffici he had not tast food for fortyeight hour and he could
not endur the miseri of his hunger in idl hide he came along a back
street glower at the loav in bakeshop window and feel that he
could trade his life away for a morsel to eat the sight of the bread
doubl his hunger but it was good to look at it ani how and imagin
what one might do if one onli had it

present in the middl of the street he saw a shine spotlook
againdid not and could not believ his eyesturn away to tri
them then look again it was a verityno vain hungerinspir
delusionit was a silver dime

he snatch itgloat over it doubt itbit itfound it genuin
choke his heart down and smother a halleluiah then he look
aroundsaw that nobodi was look at himthrew the dime down where it
was beforewalk away a few step and approach again pretend he
did not know it was there so that he could reenjoy the luxuri of
find it he walk around it view it from differ point then
saunter about with his hand in his pocket look up at the sign
and now and then glanc at it and feel the old thrill again
final he took it up and went away fondl it in his pocket he
idl through unfrequ street stop in doorway and corner to
take it out and look at it by and by he went home to his lodgingsan
empti queenswar hogshead and employ himself till night tri to
make up his mind what to buy with it but it was hard to do to get the
most for it was the idea he knew that at the miner restaur he
could get a plate of bean and a piec of bread for ten cent or a
fishbal and some few trifl but they gave no bread with one
fishball there at french pete he could get a veal cutlet plain
and some radish and bread for ten cent or a cup of coffeea pint at
leastand a slice of bread but the slice was not thick enough by the
eighth of an inch and sometim they were still more crimin than that
in the cut of it at seven oclock his hunger was wolfish and still
his mind was not made up he turn out and went up merchant street
still cipher and chew a bit of stick as is the way of starv
men

he pass befor the light of martin restaur the most aristocrat
in the citi and stop it was a place where he had often dine in
better day and martin knew him well stand asid just out of the
rang of the light he worship the quail and steak in the show
window and imagin that may be the fairi time were not gone yet and
some princ in disguis would come along present and tell him to go in
there and take whatev he want he chew his stick with a hungri
interest as he warm to his subject just at this junctur he was
conscious of some one at his side sure enough and then a finger touch
his arm he look up over his shoulder and saw an apparitiona veri
allegori of hunger it was a man six feet high gaunt unshaven hung
with rag with a haggard face and sunken cheek and eye that plead
piteous this phantom said

come with mepleas 

he lock his arm in blucher and walk up the street to where the
passeng were few and the light not strong and then face about put
out his hand in a beseech way and said

friendstrangerlook at me life is easi to youyou go about placid
and content as i did onc in my dayyou have been in there and eaten

blucher was bewilderedand touch toostir to the depth he
reflect thought again then an idea struck him and he said

he took the outcast arm walk him down to martin restaur seat
him at a marbl tabl place the bill of fare befor him and said

order what you want friend charg it to me mr martin

then blucher step back and lean against the counter and watch the

three radish with his dime and set to and feast like a king

take the episod all around it was as odd as ani that can be cull from
the myriad curios of californian life perhap




chapter lx

by and by an old friend of mine a miner came down from one of the
decay mine camp of tuolumn california and i went back with him
we live in a small cabin on a verdant hillsid and there were not five
other cabin in view over the wide expans of hill and forest yet a
flourish citi of two or three thousand popul had occupi this
grassi dead solitud dure the flush time of twelv or fifteen year
befor and where our cabin stood had onc been the heart of the teem
hive the centr of the citi when the mine gave out the town fell into
decay and in a few year wholli disappearedstreet dwell shop
everythingand left no sign the grassi slope were as green and smooth
and desol of life as if they had never been disturb the mere
hand of miner still remain had seen the town spring up spread
grow and flourish in it pride and they had seen it sicken and die and
pass away like a dream with it their hope had die and their zest of
life they had long ago resign themselv to their exil and ceas
to correspond with their distant friend or turn long eye toward
their earli home they had accept banish forgotten the world and
been forgotten of the world they were far from telegraph and
railroad and they stood as it were in a live grave dead to the
event that stir the globe great popul dead to the common
interest of men isol and outcast from brotherhood with their kind
it was the most singular and almost the most touch and melancholi
exil that fanci can imagin one of my associ in this local for
two or three month was a man who had had a univers educ but
now for eighteen year he had decay there by inch a beard
roughclad claystain miner and at time among his sigh and
soliloqu he unconsci interject vagu rememb latin and
greek sentencesdead and musti tongu meet vehicl for the thought
of one whose dream were all of the past whose life was a failur a
tire man burden with the present and indiffer to the futur a
man without tie hope interest wait for rest and the end

in that one littl corner of california is found a speci of mine
which is seldom or never mention in print it is call pocket
mining and i am not awar that ani of it is done outsid of that littl
corner the gold is not even distribut through the surfac dirt as
in ordinari placer mine but is collect in littl spot and they are
veri wide apart and exceed hard to find but when you do find one
you reap a rich and sudden harvest there are not now more than twenti
pocket miner in that entir littl region i think i know everi one of
them person i have known one of them to hunt patient about the
hillsid everi day for eight month without find gold enough to make
a snuffboxhi groceri bill run up relentless all the timeand
then find a pocket and take out of it two thousand dollar in two dip of
his shovel i have known him to take out three thousand dollar in two
hour and go and pay up everi cent of his indebted then enter on a
dazzl spree that finish the last of his treasur befor the night
was gone and the next day he bought his groceri on credit as usual
and shoulder his pan and shovel and went off to the hill hunt
pocket again happi and content this is the most fascin of all the
differ kind of mine and furnish a veri handsom percentag of
victim to the lunat asylum

pocket hunt is an ingeni process you take a spade of earth
from the hillsid and put it in a larg tin pan and dissolv and wash it
gradual away till noth is left but a teaspoon of fine sediment
whatev gold was in that earth has remain becaus be the
heaviest it has sought the bottom among the sediment you will find
half a dozen yellow particl no larger than pinhead you are
delight you move off to one side and wash anoth pan if you find
gold again you move to one side further and wash a third pan if you
find no gold this time you are delight again becaus you know you are
on the right scent

you lay an imaginari plan shape like a fan with it handl up the
hillfor just where the end of the handl is you argu that the rich
deposit lie hidden whose vagrant grain of gold have escap and been
wash down the hill spread farther and farther apart as they
wander and so you proceed up the hill wash the earth and
narrow your line everi time the absenc of gold in the pan show that
you are outsid the spread of the fan and at last twenti yard up the
hill your line have converg to a pointa singl foot from that point
you cannot find ani gold your breath come short and quick you are
feverish with excit the dinnerbel may ring it clapper off you
pay no attent friend may die wed transpir hous burn down
they are noth to you you sweat and dig and delv with a frantic
interestand all at onc you strike it up come a spade of earth
and quartz that is all love with soil lump and leav and spray of
gold sometim that one spade is all sometim the nest
contain   and it take you three or four day to get it all out
the pocketmin tell of one nest that yield   and two men
exhaust it in two week and then sold the ground for   to a
parti who never got  out of it afterward

the hog are good pocket hunter all the summer they root around the
bush and turn up a thousand littl pile of dirt and then the miner
long for the rain for the rain beat upon these littl pile and wash
them down and expos the gold possibl right over a pocket two pocket
were found in this way by the same man in one day one had   in it
and the other   that man could appreci it for he hadnt had a
cent for about a year

in tuolumn live two miner who use to go to the neighbor villag in
the afternoon and return everi night with household suppli part of
the distanc they travers a trail and near alway sat down to rest
on a great boulder that lay besid the path in the cours of thirteen
year they had worn that boulder toler smooth sit on it by and
by two vagrant mexican came along and occupi the seat they began to
amus themselv by chip off flake from the boulder with a
sledgehamm they examin one of these flake and found it rich with
gold that boulder paid them  afterward but the aggrav
circumst was that these greasers knew that there must be more gold
where that boulder came from and so they went pan up the hill and
found what was probabl the richest pocket that region has yet produc
it took three month to exhaust it and it yield   the two
american miner who use to sit on the boulder are poor yet and they
take turn about in get up earli in the morn to curs those
mexicansand when it come down to pure ornament curs the nativ
american is gift abov the son of men

i have dwelt at some length upon this matter of pocket mine becaus it
is a subject that is seldom refer to in print and therefor i judg
that it would have for the reader that interest which natur attach
to novelti




chapter lxi

one of my comrad thereanoth of those victim of eighteen year of
unrequit toil and blight hopeswa one of the gentlest spirit that
ever bore it patient cross in a weari exil grave and simpl dick
baker pocketmin of deadhous gulch he was fortysix gray as a
rat earnest thought slender educ slouchili dress and
claysoil but his heart was finer metal than ani gold his shovel ever
brought to lightthan ani inde that ever was mine or mint

whenev he was out of luck and a littl downheart he would fall to
mourn over the loss of a wonder cat he use to own for where women
and children are not men of kind impuls take up with pet for they
must love someth and he alway spoke of the strang sagac of
that cat with the air of a man who believ in his secret heart that
there was someth human about itmay be even supernatur

i heard him talk about this anim onc he said

gentlemen i use to have a cat here by the name of tom quartz which
youd a took an interest in i reckonmost ani bodi would i had him
here eight yearand he was the remarkablest cat i ever see he was a
larg gray one of the tom speci an he had more hard natchral sens
than ani man in this campn a power of dignityh wouldnt let the
govner of californi be familiar with him he never ketch a rat in his
lifepear to be abov it he never care for noth but mine
he know more about mine that cat did than ani man i ever ever see
you couldnt tell him nothn bout placer digginsn as for pocket
mine whi he was just born for it

he would dig out after me an jim when we went over the hill
prospectn and he would trot along behind us for as much as five mile
if we went so fur an he had the best judgment about mine groundwhi
you never see anyth like it when we went to work hed scatter a
glanc around n if he didnt think much of the indic he would
give a look as much as to say well ill have to get you to excus me 
n without anoth word hed hyst his nose into the air n shove for
home but if the ground suit him he would lay low n keep dark till
the first pan was wash n then he would sidl up n take a look an
if there was about six or seven grain of gold he was satisfiedh
didnt want no better prospect n thatn then he would lay down on
our coat and snore like a steamboat till wed struck the pocket an
then get up n superintend he was near lightnin on superintend

well bye an bye up come this yer quartz excit everi bodi was
into iteveri bodi was pickn n blastn instead of shovelin dirt on
the hill sideeveri bodi was putn down a shaft instead of scrapin the
surfac nothn would do jim but we must tackl the ledg too n
so we did we commenc putn down a shaft n tom quartz he begin to
wonder what in the dicken it was all about he hadnt ever seen ani
mine like that befor n he was all upset as you may sayh
couldnt come to a right understand of it no wayit was too mani for
him he was down on it too you bet youh was down on it power
n alway appear to consid it the cussedest foolish out but
that cat you know was alway agin new fangl arrangementssomehow he
never could abideem you know how it is with old habit but by an by
tom quartz begin to git sort of reconcil a littl though he never
could altogeth understand that etern sinkin of a shaft an never
pannin out ani thing at last he got to comin down in the shaft
hisself to tri to cipher it out an when hed git the blue n feel
kind oscruffi n aggrav n disgustedknowin as he did that the
bill was runnin up all the time an we warnt makin a centh would
curl up on a gunni sack in the corner an go to sleep well one day
when the shaft was down about eight foot the rock got so hard that we
had to put in a blastth first blastn wed ever done sinc tom quartz
was born an then we lit the fuse n clumb out n got off bout fifti
yardsn forgot n left tom quartz sound asleep on the gunni sack

in bout a minut we seen a puff of smoke bust up out of the hole n
then everyth let go with an aw crash n about four million ton of
rock n dirt n smoke n splinter shot up bout a mile an a half
into the air an by georg right in the dead centr of it was old tom
quartz a goin end over end an a snortin an a sneezn an a clawin
an a reachin for thing like all possess but it warnt no use you
know it warnt no use an that was the last we see of him for about
two minut n a half an then all of a sudden it begin to rain rock
and rubbag an direct he come down kerwhop about ten foot off fm
where we stood well i reckon he was prap the orneriest lookin beast
you ever see one ear was sot back on his neck n his tail was stove
up n his eyewink was swing off n he was all black up with
powder an smoke an all sloppi with mud n slush fm one end to the
other

well sir it warnt no use to tri to apologizew couldnt say a word
he took a sort of a disgust look at hisself n then he look at us
an it was just exact the same as if he had saidgent may be you
think it smart to take advantag of a cat that aint had no experi
of quartz minin but i think differentan then he turn on his heel
n march off home without ever say anoth word

that was jest his style an may be you wont believ it but after
that you never see a cat so prejud agin quartz mine as what he was
an by an bye when he did get to goin down in the shaft agin youd a
been astonish at his sagac the minut wed tetch off a blast n
the fused begin to sizzl hed give a look as much as to say well
ill have to git you to excus me  an it was surprisn the way hed
shin out of that hole n go fr a tree sagac it aint no name for
it twas inspir 

i said well mr baker his prejudic against quartzmin was
remark consid how he came by it couldnt you ever cure him of
it 

cure him no when tom quartz was sot onc he was alway sotand you
might a blow him up as much as three million time n youd never a
broken him of his cuss prejudic agin quartz mine 

the affect and the pride that lit up baker face when he deliv
this tribut to the firm of his humbl friend of other day will
alway be a vivid memori with me

at the end of two month we had never struck a pocket we had pan
up and down the hillsid till they look plow like a field we could
have put in a crop of grain then but there would have been no way to
get it to market we got mani good prospect  but when the gold gave
out in the pan and we dug down hope and long we found onli
emptinessth pocket that should have been there was as barren as our
own at last we shoulder our pan and shovel and struck out over the
hill to tri new local we prospect around angel camp in
calavera counti dure three week but had no success then we
wander on foot among the mountain sleep under the tree at night
for the weather was mild but still we remain as centless as the last
rose of summer that is a poor joke but it is in pathet harmoni with
the circumst sinc we were so poor ourselv in accord with
the custom of the countri our door had alway stood open and our board
welcom to tramp minersthey drift along near everi day dump
their paust shovel by the threshold and took pot luck with usand now
on our own tramp we never found cold hospit

our wander were wide and in mani direct and now i could give the
reader a vivid descript of the big tree and the marvel of the yo
semitebut what has this reader done to me that i should persecut him
i will deliv him into the hand of less conscienti tourist and take
his bless let me be charit though i fail in all virtu els

note some of the phrase in the abov are mine technic pure
and may be a littl obscur to the general reader in placer diggings
the gold is scatter all through the surfac dirt in pocket dig
it is concentr in one littl spot in quartz the gold is in a
solid continu vein of rock enclos between distinct wall of some
other kind of stoneand this is the most labori and expens of all
the differ kind of mine prospecting is hunt for a placer
indications are sign of it presenc pan out refer to the
wash process by which the grain of gold are separ from the dirt
a prospect is what one find in the first pan of dirtand it valu
determin whether it is a good or a bad prospect and whether it is
worth while to tarri there or seek further




chapter lxii

after a three month absenc i found myself in san francisco again
without a cent when my credit was about exhaust for i had becom
too mean and lazi now to work on a morn paper and there were no
vacanc on the even journal i was creat san francisco
correspond of the enterpris and at the end of five month i was out
of debt but my interest in my work was gone for my correspond be
a daili one without rest or respit i got unspeak tire of it
i want anoth chang the vagabond instinct was strong upon me
fortun favor and i got a new berth and a delight one it was to go
down to the sandwich island and write some letter for the sacramento
union an excel journal and liber with employe

we sail in the propel ajax in the middl of winter the almanac
call it winter distinct enough but the weather was a compromis
between spring and summer six day out of port it becam summer
altogeth we had some thirti passeng among them a cheer soul
by the name of william and three seaworn old whaleship captain go
down to join their vessel these latter play euchr in the smoke
room day and night drank astonish quantiti of raw whiski without
be in the least affect by it and were the happiest peopl i think
i ever saw and then there was the old admiral a retir whaleman
he was a roar terrif combin of wind and lightn and thunder
and earnest wholesoul profan but nevertheless he was
tenderheart as a girl he was a rave deafen devast
typhoon lay wast the cower sea but with an unvex refug in the
centr where all comer were safe and at rest nobodi could know the
admiral without like him and in a sudden and dire emerg i think
no friend of his would know which to chooseto be curs by him or
pray for by a less effici person

his titl of admiral was more strict official than ani ever worn by
a naval offic befor or sinc perhapsfor it was the voluntari
offer of a whole nation and came direct from the peopl themselv
without ani intermedi red tapeth peopl of the sandwich island
it was a titl that came to him freight with affect and honor and
appreci of his unpretend merit and in testimoni of the
genuin of the titl it was public ordain that an exclus flag
should be devis for him and use sole to welcom his come and wave
him godspe in his go from that time forth whenev his ship was
signal in the of or he cat his anchor and stood out to sea
that ensign stream from the royal halliard on the parliament hous and
the nation lift their hat to it with spontan accord

yet he had never fire a gun or fought a battl in his life when i knew
him on board the ajax he was seventytwo year old and had plow the
salt water sixtyon of them for sixteen year he had gone in and out
of the harbor of honolulu in command of a whaleship and for sixteen more
had been captain of a san francisco and sandwich island passeng packet
and had never had an accid or lost a vessel the simpl nativ knew
him for a friend who never fail them and regard him as children
regard a father it was a danger thing to oppress them when the
roar admir was around

two year befor i knew the admir he had retir from the sea on a
compet and had sworn a coloss ninejoint oath that he would
never go within smell distanc of the salt water again as long as he
live  and he had conscienti kept it that is to say he
consid he had kept it and it would have been more than danger to
suggest to him even in the gentlest way that make eleven long sea
voyag as a passeng dure the two year that had transpir sinc
he retir  was onli keep the general spirit of it and not the
strict letter

the admir knew onli one narrow line of conduct to pursu in ani and all
case where there was a fight and that was to shoulder his way straight
in without an inquiri as to the right or the merit of it and take the
part of the weaker side and this was the reason whi he was alway sure
to be present at the trial of ani univers execr crimin to
oppress and intimid the juri with a vindict pantomim of what he
would do to them if he ever caught them out of the box and this was whi
harri cat and outlaw dog that knew him confid took sanctuari
under his chair in time of troubl in the begin he was the most
frantic and bloodthirsti union man that drew breath in the shadow of the
flag but the instant the southern began to go down befor the sweep
of the northern armi he ran up the confeder color and from that
time till the end was a rampant and inexor secessionist

he hate intemper with a more uncompromis animos than ani
individu i have ever met of either sex and he was never tire of
storm against it and beseech friend and stranger alik to be wari
and drink with moder and yet if ani creatur had been guileless
enough to intim that his absorb nine gallon of straight whiskey
dure our voyag was ani fraction short of rigid or inflex
abstemi in that selfsam moment the old man would have spun him
to the uttermost part of the earth in the whirlwind of his wrath mind
i am not say his whiski ever affect his head or his leg for it did
not in even the slightest degre he was a capaci contain but he
did not hold enough for that he took a level tumbler of whiski everi
morn befor he put his cloth onto sweeten his bilgewat  he
said he took anoth after he got the most of his cloth on to
settl his mind and give him his bear  he then shave and put on a
clean shirt after which he recit the lord prayer in a fervent
thunder bass that shook the ship to her kelson and suspend all
convers in the main cabin then at this stage be invari
bi the head  or bi the stern  or list to port or starboard  he
took one more to put him on an even keel so that he would mind his
hellum and not miss stay and go about everi time he came up in the
wind and now his stateroom door swung open and the sun of his
benign face beam red out upon men and women and children and he
roar his shipmet ahoy  in a way that was calcul to wake the
dead and precipit the final resurrect and forth he strode a
pictur to look at and a presenc to enforc attent stalwart and

the admir seldom read newspap and when he did he never believ
anyth they said he read noth and believ in noth but the

readi for a polit argument and if nobodi start one he would do it
himself with his third retort his temper would begin to rise and
within five minut he would be blow a gale and within fifteen his

whenev the admir approach with polit in his eye the passeng
would drop out with quiet accord afraid to meet him and he would camp
on a desert field

but he found his match at last and befor a full compani at one time
or anoth everybodi had enter the list against him and been rout
except the quiet passeng william he had never been abl to get an
express of opinion out of him on polit but now just as the
admir drew near the door and the compani were about to slip out
william said

admir are you certain about that circumst concern the
clergymen you mention the other day refer to a piec of the
admir manufactur histori

everi one was amaz at the man rash the idea of deliber
invit annihil was a thing incomprehens the retreat came to
a halt then everybodi sat down again wonder to await the upshot of
it the admir himself was as surpris as ani one he paus in the
door with his red handkerchief half rais to his sweat face and
contempl the dare reptil in the corner

certain of it am i certain of it do you think iv been lie about
it what do you take me for anybodi that dont know that circumst
dont know anyth a child ought to know it read up your histori
read it up and dont come ask a man if he certain about a bit
of abc stuff that the veri southern nigger know all about 

here the admir fire began to wax hot the atmospher thicken the
come earthquak rumbl he began to thunder and lighten within three
minut his volcano was in full irrupt and he was discharg flame
and ash of indign belch black volum of foul histori aloft
and vomit redhot torrent of profan from his crater meantim
william sat silent and appar deepli and earnest interest in
what the old man was say by and by when the lull came he said in
the most deferenti way and with the gratifi air of a man who has had
a mysteri clear up which had been puzzl him uncomfort

now i understand it i alway thought i knew that piec of histori well
enough but was still afraid to trust it becaus there was not that
convinc particular about it that one like to have in histori but
when you mention everi name the other day and everi date and everi
littl circumst in their just order and sequenc i said to myself
this sound someth likethi is historythi is put it in a
shape that give a man confid and i said to myself afterward i will
just ask the admir if he is perfect certain about the detail and if
he is i will come out and thank him for clear this matter up for me
and that is what i want to do nowfor until you set that matter right it
was noth but just a confus in my mind without head or tail to it 

nobodi ever saw the admir look so mollifi befor and so pleas
nobodi had ever receiv his bogus histori as gospel befor it
genuin had alway been call in question either by word or look
but here was a man that not onli swallow it all down but was grate
for the dose he was taken a back he hard knew what to say even his
profan fail him now william continu modest and earnest

but admir in say that this was the first stone thrown and that
this precipit the war you have overlook a circumst which you
are perfect familiar with but which has escap your memori now i
grant you that what you have state is correct in everi detailto wit
that on the th of octob  two massachusett clergymen name
wait and granger went in disguis to the hous of john moodi in
rockport at dead of night and drag forth two southern women and
their two littl children and after tar and feather them convey
them to boston and burn them aliv in the state hous squar and i
also grant your proposit that this deed is what led to the secess
of south carolina on the th of decemb follow veri well  here
the compani were pleasant surpris to hear william proceed to come
back at the admir with his own invinc weaponclean pure
manufactur histori without a word of truth in it  veri well i say
but admir whi overlook the willi and morgan case in south carolina
you are too well inform a man not to know all about that circumst
your argument and your convers have shown you to be intim
convers with everi detail of this nation quarrel you develop
matter of histori everi day that show plain that you are no smatter
in it content to nibbl about the surfac but a man who has search
the depth and possess yourself of everyth that has a bear upon
the great question therefor let me just recal to your mind that
willi and morgan casethough i see by your face that the whole thing is
alreadi pass through your memori at this moment on the th of
august  two month befor the wait and granger affair two south
carolina clergymen name john h morgan and winthrop l willi one a
methodist and the other an old school baptist disguis themselv and
went at midnight to the hous of a planter name thompsonarchibald f
thompson vice presid under thoma jefferson and took thenc at
midnight his widow aunt a northern woman and her adopt child an
orphannam mortim highi afflict with epilepsi and suffer at
the time from white swell on one of his leg and compel to walk on
crutch in consequ and the two minist in spite of the plead
of the victim drag them to the bush tar and feather them and
afterward burn them at the stake in the citi of charleston you
rememb perfect well what a stir it made you rememb perfect well
that even the charleston courier stigmat the act as be unpleas
of question proprieti and scarc justifi and likewis that it
would not be matter of surpris if retali ensu and you rememb
also that this thing was the caus of the massachusett outrag who
inde were the two massachusett minist and who were the two
southern women they burn i do not need to remind you admir with
your intim knowledg of histori that wait was the nephew of the
woman burn in charleston that granger was her cousin in the second
degre and that the woman they burn in boston was the wife of john h
morgan and the still love but divorc wife of winthrop l willi
now admir it is onli fair that you should acknowledg that the first
provoc came from the southern preacher and that the northern one
were justifi in retali in your argument you never yet have
shown the least disposit to withhold a just verdict or be in anywis
unfair when authorit histori condemn your posit and therefor
i have no hesit in ask you to take the origin blame from the
massachusett minist in this matter and transfer it to the south
carolina clergymen where it just belong 

the admir was conquer this sweet spoken creatur who swallow his
fraudul histori as if it were the bread of life bask in his furious
blasphemi as if it were generous sunshin found onli calm evenhand
justic in his rampart partisanship and flood him with invent
histori so sugarco with flatteri and defer that there was no
reject it was too many for him he stammer some awkward profan
sentenc about thewilli and morgan busi have escap his
memori but that he rememb it now  and then under pretenc of
give fan some medicin for an imaginari cough drew out of the battl
and went away a vanquish man then cheer and laughter went up and
william the ship benefactor was a hero the news went about the
vessel champagn was order and enthusiast recept institut in
the smoke room and everybodi flock thither to shake hand with the
conqueror the wheelman said afterward that the admir stood up behind
the pilot hous and rip and curs all to himself till he loosen
the smokestack guy and becalm the mainsail

the admir power was broken after that if he began argument
somebodi would bring william and the old man would grow weak and begin
to quiet down at onc and as soon as he was done william in his
dulcet insinu way would invent some histori refer for proof
to the old man own excel memori and to copi of the old guard
known not to be in his possess that would turn the tabl complet
and leav the admir all abroad and helpless by and by he came to so
dread william and his gild tongu that he would stop talk when he
saw him approach and final ceas to mention polit altogeth and
from that time forward there was entir peac and seren in the ship

chapter lxiv

in my diari of our third day in honolulu i find this

i am probabl the most sensit man in hawaii tonightespeci about
sit down in the presenc of my better i have ridden fifteen or
twenti mile on horseback sinc  p m and to tell the honest truth i
have a delicaci about sit down at all

an excurs to diamond head and the king coacoanut grove was plan
todaytim   p m the parti to consist of half a dozen gentlemen
and three ladi they all start at the appoint hour except myself
i was at the govern prison with captain fish and anoth
whaleshipskipp captain phillip and got so interest in it
examin that i did not notic how quick the time was pass
somebodi remark that it was twenti minut past five oclock and that
woke me up it was a fortun circumst that captain phillip was
along with his turn out  as he call a topbuggi that captain cook
brought here in  and a hors that was here when captain cook came
captain phillip take a just pride in his drive and in the speed of
his hors and to his passion for display them i owe it that we were
onli sixteen minut come from the prison to the american hotela
distanc which has been estim to be over half a mile but it took
some fear drive the captain whip came down fast and the blow
start so much dust out of the hors hide that dure the last half of
the journey we rode through an impenetr fog and ran by a pocket
compass in the hand of captain fish a whaler of twentysix year
experi who sat there through the peril voyag as selfpossess
as if he had been on the euchredeck of his own ship and calm said
port your helmport  from time to time and hold her a littl free
steadysoso  and luffhard down to starboard  and never onc
lost his presenc of mind or betray the least anxieti by voic or
manner when we came to anchor at last and captain phillip look at
his watch and said sixteen minutesi told you it was in her that
over three mile an hour  i could see he felt entitl to a compliment
and so i said i had never seen lightn go like that hors and i never
had

the landlord of the american said the parti had been gone near an hour
but that he could give me my choic of sever hors that could overtak
them i said never mindi prefer a safe hors to a fast onei
would like to have an excess gentl horsea hors with no spirit
whatevera lame one if he had such a thing insid of five minut i
was mount and perfect satisfi with my outfit i had no time to
label him this is a hors  and so if the public took him for a sheep i
cannot help it i was satisfi and that was the main thing i could
see that he had as mani fine point as ani man hors and so i hung my
hat on one of them behind the saddl and swab the perspir from
my face and start i name him after this island oahu pronounc
owawhe the first gate he came to he start in i had neither whip
nor spur and so i simpli argu the case with him he resist
argument but ultim yield to insult and abus he back out of
that gate and steer for anoth one on the other side of the street
i triumph by my former process within the next six hundr yard he
cross the street fourteen time and attempt thirteen gate and in
the meantim the tropic sun was beat down and threaten to cave
the top of my head in and i was liter drip with perspir
he abandon the gate busi after that and went along peaceabl
enough but absorb in medit i notic this latter circumst
and it soon began to fill me with apprehens i said to my self this
creatur is plan some new outrag some fresh deviltri or otherno
hors ever thought over a subject so profound as this one is do just
for noth the more this thing prey upon my mind the more uneasi i
becam until the suspens becam almost unbear and i dismount to
see if there was anyth wild in his eyefor i had heard that the eye
of this noblest of our domest anim is veri express

i cannot describ what a load of anxieti was lift from my mind when i
found that he was onli asleep i woke him up and start him into a
faster walk and then the villaini of his natur came out again he
tri to climb over a stone wall five or six feet high i saw that i
must appli forc to this hors and that i might as well begin first as
last i pluck a stout switch from a tamarind tree and the moment he
saw it he surrend he broke into a convuls sort of a canter
which had three short step in it and one long one and remind me
altern of the clatter shake of the great earthquak and the
sweep plung of the ajax in a storm

and now there can be no fitter occas than the present to pronounc a
lefthand bless upon the man who invent the american saddl
there is no seat to speak of about iton might as well sit in a shovel
and the stirrup are noth but an ornament nuisanc if i were to
write down here all the abus i expend on those stirrup it would make
a larg book even without pictur sometim i got one foot so far
through that the stirrup partook of the natur of an anklet sometim
both feet were through and i was handcuf by the leg and sometim
my feet got clear out and left the stirrup wild dangl about my
shin even when i was in proper posit and care balanc upon
the ball of my feet there was no comfort in it on account of my
nervous dread that they were go to slip one way or the other in a
moment but the subject is too exasper to write about

a mile and a half from town i came to a grove of tall cocoanut tree
with clean branchless stem reach straight up sixti or seventi feet
and top with a spray of green foliag shelter cluster of
cocoanutsnot more picturesqu than a forest of colloss rag
parasol with bunch of magnifi grape under them would be

i onc heard a gouti northern invalid say that a cocoanut tree might be
poetic possibl it was but it look like a featherdust struck by
lightn i think that describ it better than a pictureand yet
without ani question there is someth fascin about a cocoanut
treeand grace too

about a dozen cottag some frame and the other of nativ grass
nestl sleepili in the shade here and there the grass cabin are of a
grayish color are shape much like our own cottag onli with higher
and steeper roof usual and are made of some kind of weed strong
bound togeth in bundl the roof are veri thick and so are the
wall the latter have squar hole in them for window at a littl
distanc these cabin have a furri appear as if they might be made
of bear skin they are veri cool and pleasant insid the king flag
was fli from the roof of one of the cottag and his majesti was
probabl within he own the whole concern thereabout and pass his
time there frequent on sultri day lay off  the spot is call
the king grove 

near by is an interest ruinth meagr remain of an ancient heathen
templea place where human sacrific were offer up in those old
bygon day when the simpl child of natur yield momentarili to sin
when sore tempt acknowledg his error when calm reflect had
shown it him and came forward with nobl frank and offer up his

show him what raptur it is to work all day long for fifti cent to buy
food for next day with as compar with fish for pastim and loll
in the shade through etern summer and eat of the bounti that nobodi
labor to provid but natur how sad it is to think of the multitud
who have gone to their grave in this beauti island and never knew
there was a hell

this ancient templ was built of rough block of lava and was simpli a
roofless inclosur a hundr and thirti feet long and seventi wide
noth but nake wall veri thick but not much higher than a man
head they will last for age no doubt if left unmolest it three
altar and other sacr appurten have crumbl and pass away year
ago it is said that in the old time thousand of human be were
slaughter here in the presenc of nake and howl savag if these
mute stone could speak what tale they could tell what pictur they
could describ of fetter victim writh under the knife of mass

when kamehameha pronounc kamayhamayah the greatwho was a sort
of a napoleon in militari genius and uniform successinvad this island
of oahu three quarter of a centuri ago and extermin the armi sent
to oppos him and took full and final possess of the countri he
search out the dead bodi of the king of oahu and those of the
princip chief and impal their head on the wall of this templ

those were savag time when this old slaughterhous was in it prime

them gather all the provis the master need build all the hous

cuff for thank drag out live well flavor with miseri and then
suffer death for trifl offenc or yield up their live on the
sacrifici altar to purchas favor from the god for their hard
ruler the missionari have cloth them educ them broken up the
tyrann author of their chief and given them freedom and the right
to enjoy whatev their hand and brain produc with equal law for all
and punish for all alik who transgress them the contrast is so
strongth benefit confer upon this peopl by the missionari is so
promin so palpabl and so unquestion that the frankest

chapter lxv

by and by after a rug climb we halt on the summit of a hill which
command a farreach view the moon rose and flood mountain and
valley and ocean with a mellow radianc and out of the shadow of the
foliag the distant light of honolulu glint like an encamp of
firefli the air was heavi with the fragranc of flower the halt
was brief gayli laugh and talk the parti gallop on and i
clung to the pommel and canter after present we came to a place
where no grass grewa wide expans of deep sand they said it was an
old battl ground all around everywher not three feet apart the
bleach bone of men gleam white in the moonlight we pick up a lot
of them for memento i got quit a number of arm bone and leg bone
of great chief may be who had fought savag in that fear battl
in the old day when blood flow like wine where we now stoodand wore
the choicest of them out on oahu afterward tri to make him go all
sort of bone could be found except skull but a citizen said
irrever that there had been an unusu number of skullhunters
there latelya speci of sportsmen i had never heard of befor

noth whatev is known about this placeit stori is a secret that
will never be reveal the oldest nativ make no pretens of be
possess of it histori they say these bone were here when they were
children they were here when their grandfath were childrenbut how
they came here they can onli conjectur mani peopl believ this spot
to be an ancient battleground and it is usual to call it so and they
believ that these skeleton have lain for age just where their
proprietor fell in the great fight other peopl believ that
kamehameha i fought his first battl here on this point i have heard
a stori which may have been taken from one of the numer book which
have been written concern these islandsi do not know where the
narrat got it he said that when kamehameha who was at first mere a
subordin chief on the island of hawaii land here he brought a
larg armi with him and encamp at waikiki the oahuan march
against him and so confid were they of success that they readili
acced to a demand of their priest that they should draw a line where
these bone now lie and take an oath that if forc to retreat at all
they would never retreat beyond this boundari the priest told them
that death and everlast punish would overtak ani who violat the
oath and the march was resum kamehameha drove them back step by
step the priest fought in the front rank and exhort them both by
voic and inspirit exampl to rememb their oathto die if need be
but never cross the fatal line the struggl was man maintain
but at last the chief priest fell pierc to the heart with a spear and
the unlucki omen fell like a blight upon the brave soul at his back
with a triumphant shout the invad press forwardth line was
crossedth offend god desert the despair armi and accept
the doom their perjuri had brought upon them they broke and fled over
the plain where honolulu stand nowup the beauti nuuanu valley
paus a moment hem in by precipit mountain on either hand and
the fright precipic of the pari in front and then were driven over
a sheer plung of six hundr feet

the stori is pretti enough but mr jarv excel histori say the
oahuan were intrench in nuuanu valley that kamehameha oust them
rout them pursu them up the valley and drove them over the
precipic he make no mention of our boneyard at all in his book

impress by the profound silenc and repos that rest over the
beauti landscap and be as usual in the rear i gave voic to my
thought i said

what a pictur is here slumber in the solemn glori of the moon how
strong the rug outlin of the dead volcano stand out against the
clear sky what a snowi fring mark the burst of the surf over the
long curv reef how calm the dim citi sleep yonder in the plain
how soft the shadow lie upon the state mountain that border the
dreamhaunt mauoa valley what a grand pyramid of billowi cloud
tower abov the stori pari how the grim warrior of the past seem
flock in ghost squadron to their ancient battlefield againhow the
wail of the die well up from the

at this point the hors call oahu sat down in the sand sat down to
listen i suppos never mind what he heard i stop apostrophis
and convinc him that i was not a man to allow contempt of court on the
part of a hors i broke the backbon of a chief over his rump and set
out to join the cavalcad again

veri consider fag out we arriv in town at  oclock at night
myself in the leadfor when my hors final came to understand that he
was homeward bound and hadnt far to go he turn his attent strict
to busi

this is a good time to drop in a paragraph of inform there is no
regular liveri stabl in honolulu or inde in ani part of the kingdom
of hawaii therefor unless you are acquaint with wealthi resid
who all have good hors you must hire anim of the wretchedest
descript from the kanaka i e nativ ani hors you hire even
though it be from a white man is not often of much account becaus it
will be brought in for you from some ranch and has necessarili been
lead a hard life if the kanaka who have been care for him
inveter rider they are have not ridden him half to death everi day
themselv you can depend upon it they have been do the same thing by
proxi by clandestin hire him out at least so i am inform the
result is that no hors has a chanc to eat drink rest recuper or
look well or feel well and so stranger go about the island mount as
i was today

in hire a hors from a kanaka you must have all your eye about you
becaus you can rest satisfi that you are deal with a shrewd
unprincipl rascal you may leav your door open and your trunk
unlock as long as you pleas and he will not meddl with your
properti he has no import vice and no inclin to commit robberi
on a larg scale but if he can get ahead of you in the hors busi
he will take a genuin delight in do it this trait is
characterist of hors jockey the world over is it not he will
overcharg you if he can he will hire you a finelook hors at night
anybodysmay be the king if the royal steed be in conveni view
and bring you the mate to my oahu in the morn and contend that it is
the same anim if you make troubl he will get out by say it was
not himself who made the bargain with you but his brother who went out
in the countri this morn  they have alway got a brother to shift
the respons upon a victim said to one of these fellow one day

but i know i hire the hors of you becaus i notic that scar on your

warrant him to be in excel condit

smith had a saddl and blanket of his own and he order the kanaka to
put these on the hors the kanaka protest that he was perfect
will to trust the gentleman with the saddl that was alreadi on the
anim but smith refus to use it the chang was made then smith
notic that the kanaka had onli chang the saddl and had left the
origin blanket on the hors he said he forgot to chang the blanket
and so to cut the bother short smith mount and rode away the hors
went lame a mile from town and afterward got to cut up some
extraordinari caper smith got down and took off the saddl but the
blanket stuck fast to the horseglu to a process of raw place
the kanaka mysteri conduct stood explain

anoth friend of mine bought a pretti good hors from a nativ a day or
two ago after a toler thorough examin of the anim he
discov today that the hors was as blind as a bat in one eye he
meant to have examin that eye and came home with a general notion that
he had done it but he rememb now that everi time he made the attempt
his attent was call to someth els by his victim

one more instanc and then i will pass to someth els i am inform
that when a certain mr l a visit stranger was here he bought a
pair of veri respectablelook match hors from a nativ they were
in a littl stabl with a partit through the middl of iton hors
in each apart mr l examin one of them critic through a
window the kanaka brother have gone to the countri with the key
and then went around the hous and examin the other through a window on
the other side he said it was the neatest match he had ever seen and
paid for the hors on the spot whereupon the kanaka depart to join
his brother in the countri the fellow had shame swindl l there
was onli one match hors and he had examin his starboard side
through one window and his port side through anoth i declin to
believ this stori but i give it becaus it is worth someth as a
fanci illustr of a fix factnam that the kanaka
horsejockey is fertil in invent and elast in conscienc

you can buy a pretti good hors for forti or fifti dollar and a good
enough hors for all practic purpos for two dollar and a half i
estim oahu to be worth somewher in the neighborhood of thirtyf
cent a good deal better anim than he is was sold here day befor
yesterday for a dollar and seventyf cent and sold again today for
two dollar and twentyf cent william bought a handsom and live
littl poni yesterday for ten dollar and about the best common hors on
the island and he is a realli good one sold yesterday with mexican
saddl and bridl for seventi dollarsa hors which is well and wide
known and great respect for his speed good disposit and
everlast bottom

you give your hors a littl grain onc a day it come from san
francisco and is worth about two cent a pound and you give him as much
hay as he want it is cut and brought to the market by nativ and is
not veri good it is bale into long round bundl about the size of a
larg man one of them is stuck by the middl on each end of a six foot
pole and the kanaka shoulder the pole and walk about the street
between the upright bale in search of custom these hay bale thus
carri have a general resembl to a coloss capit h 

the haybundl cost twentyf cent apiec and one will last a hors
about a day you can get a hors for a song a week hay for anoth
song and you can turn your anim loos among the luxuri grass in
your neighbor broad front yard without a song at allyou do it at
midnight and stabl the beast again befor morn you have been at no
expens thus far but when you come to buy a saddl and bridl they will
cost you from twenti to thirtyf dollar you can hire a hors
saddl and bridl at from seven to ten dollar a week and the owner will
take care of them at his own expens

pass through the market place we saw that featur of honolulu under
it most favor auspicesthat is in the full glori of saturday
afternoon which is a festiv day with the nativ the nativ girl by
twos and three and parti of a dozen and sometim in whole platoon
and compani went canter up and down the neighbor street astrid
of fleet but home hors and with their gaudi ride habit stream
like banner behind them such a troop of free and easi rider in their
natur home the saddl make a gay and grace spectacl the ride
habit i speak of is simpli a long broad scarf like a tavern tabl cloth
brilliant color wrap around the loin onc then appar
pass between the limb and each end thrown backward over the same and
float and flap behind on both side beyond the hors tail like a
coupl of fanci flag then slip the stirrupiron between her toe
the girl throw her chest for ward sit up like a major general and goe
sweep by like the wind

the girl put on all the fineri they can on saturday afternoonfin
black silk robe flow red one that near put your eye out other
as white as snow still other that discount the rainbow and they wear
their hair in net and trim their jaunti hat with fresh flower and
encircl their duski throat with homemad necklac of the brilliant
vermilliontint blossom of the ohia and they fill the market and the
adjac street with their bright presenc and smell like a rag factori
on fire with their offens cocoanut oil

occasion you see a heathen from the sunni isl away down in the
south sea with his face and neck tatoo till he look like the
customari mendic from washo who has been blown up in a mine some
are tattoo a dead blue color down to the upper lipmask as it were
leav the natur light yellow skin of micronesia unstain from
thenc down some with broad mark drawn down from hair to neck on both
side of the face and a strip of the origin yellow skin two inch
wide down the centera gridiron with a spoke broken out and some with
the entir face discolor with the popular mortif tint reliev
onli by one or two thin wavi thread of natur yellow run across
the face from ear to ear and eye twinkl out of this dark from
under shadow hatbrim like star in the dark of the moon

move among the stir crowd you come to the poi merchant
squat in the shade on their ham in true nativ fashion and
surround by purchas the sandwich island alway squat on their
ham and who know but they may be the old origin ham sandwich 
the thought is pregnant with interest the poi look like common flour
past and is kept in larg bowl form of a speci of gourd and
capabl of hold from one to three or four gallon poi is the chief
articl of food among the nativ and is prepar from the taro plant

the taro root look like a thick or if you pleas a corpul sweet
potato in shape but is of a light purpl color when boil when
boil it answer as a passabl substitut for bread the buck kanaka
bake it under ground then mash it up well with a heavi lava pestl mix
water with it until it becom a past set it asid and let if ferment
and then it is poiand an unseduct mixtur it is almost tasteless
befor it ferment and too sour for a luxuri afterward but noth is
more nutriti when sole use howev it produc acrid humor a
fact which suffici account for the humor charact of the
kanaka i think there must be as much of a knack in handl poi as
there is in eat with chopstick the forefing is thrust into the
mess and stir quick round sever time and drawn as quick out
thick coat just as it it were poultic the head is thrown back
the finger insert in the mouth and the delicaci strip off and
swallowedth eye close gentl meanwhil in a languid sort of
ecstasi mani a differ finger goe into the same bowl and mani a
differ kind of dirt and shade and qualiti of flavor is ad to the
virtu of it content

around a small shanti was collect a crowd of nativ buy the awa
root it is said that but for the use of this root the destruct of
the peopl in former time by certain import diseas would have been
far greater than it was and by other it is said that this is mere a
fanci all agre that poi will rejuven a man who is use up and his
vital almost annihil by hard drink and that in some kind of
diseas it will restor health after all medicin have fail but all
are not will to allow to the awa the virtu claim for it the
nativ manufactur an intox drink from it which is fear in it
effect when persist indulg in it cover the bodi with dri
white scale inflam the eye and caus prematur decripitud
although the man befor whose establish we stop has to pay a
govern licens of eight hundr dollar a year for the exclus
right to sell awa root it is said that he make a small fortun everi
twelvemonth while saloon keeper who pay a thousand dollar a year for
the privileg of retail whiskey etc onli make a bare live

we found the fish market crowd for the nativ is veri fond of fish
and eat the articl raw and aliv let us chang the subject

in old time here saturday was a grand gala day inde all the nativ
popul of the town forsook their labor and those of the surround
countri journey to the citi then the white folk had to stay indoor
for everi street was so pack with charg cavali and cavalieress
that it was next to imposs to thread one way through the cavalcad
without get crippl

at night they feast and the girl danc the lascivi hula hulaa
danc that is said to exhibit the veri perfect of educ notion of
limb and arm hand head and bodi and the exactest uniform of
movement and accuraci of time  it was perform by a circl of girl
with no raiment on them to speak of who went through an infinit varieti
of motion and figur without prompt and yet so true was their
time  and in such perfect concert did they move that when they were
place in a straight line hand arm bodi limb and head wave
sway gesticul bow stoop whirl squirm twist and
undul as if they were part and parcel of a singl individu and it
was difficult to believ they were not move in a bodi by some exquisit
piec of mechan

of late year howev saturday has lost most of it quondam gala
featur this week stamped of the nativ interf too much with
labor and the interest of the white folk and by stick in a law
here and preach a sermon there and by various other mean they
gradual broke it up the demor hula hula was forbidden to be
perform save at night with close door in presenc of few
spectat and onli by permiss duli procur from the author and
the payment of ten dollar for the same there are few girl nowaday
abl to danc this ancient nation danc in the highest perfect of

the missionari have christian and educ all the nativ they
all belong to the church and there is not one of them abov the age of
eight year but can read and write with facil in the nativ tongu
it is the most univers educ race of peopl outsid of china
they have ani quantiti of book print in the kanaka languag and all
the nativ are fond of read they are inveter churchgoer
noth can keep them away all this amelior cultiv has at
last built up in the nativ women a profound respect for chastityin
other peopl perhap that is enough to say on that head the nation
sin will die out when the race doe but perhap not earlier but
doubtless this purifi is not far off when we reflect that contact
with civil and the white has reduc the nativ popul from
four hundr thousand captain cook estim to fiftyf thousand
in someth over eighti year

societi is a queer medley in this notabl missionari whale and
government centr if you get into convers with a stranger and
experi that natur desir to know what sort of ground you are
tread on by find out what manner of man your stranger is strike
out bold and address him as captain  watch him narrowli and if you
see by his counten that you are on the wrong tack ask him where he
preach it is a safe bet that he is either a missionari or captain of
a whaler i am now person acquaint with seventytwo captain and
ninetysix missionari the captain and minist form onehalf of the

foreign and their famili and the final fourth is made up of high

chapter lxvii

i still quot from my journal

i found the nation legislatur to consist of half a dozen white men and
some thirti or forti nativ it was a dark assemblag the nobl and
minist about a dozen of them altogeth occupi the extrem left of
the hall with david kalakaua the king chamberlain and princ william
at the head the presid of the assembl his royal high m
kekuanaoa kekuanaoa is not of the blood royal he deriv his princ
rank from his wife who was a daughter of kamehameha the great under
other monarchi the male line take preced of the femal in trace
genealog but here the opposit is the caseth femal line take
preced their reason for this is exceed sensibl and i
recommend it to the aristocraci of europ they say it is easi to know
who a man mother was but etc etc  and the vice presid the
latter a white man sat in the pulpit if i may so term it
the presid is the king father he is an erect strong built
massiv featur whitehair tawni old gentleman of eighti year of
age or thereabout he was simpli but well dress in a blue cloth coat
and white vest and white pantaloon without spot dust or blemish upon
them he bear himself with a calm state digniti and is a man of
nobl presenc he was a young man and a distinguish warrior under
that terrif fighter kamehameha i more than half a centuri ago a
knowledg of his career suggest some such thought as this this man
nake as the day he was born and warclub and spear in hand has charg
at the head of a hord of savag against other hord of savag more
than a generat and a half ago and revel in slaughter and carnag
has worship wooden imag on his devout knee has seen hundr of
his race offer up in heathen templ as sacrific to wooden idol at
a time when no missionari foot had ever press this soil and he had
never heard of the white man god has believ his enemi could secret
pray him to death has seen the day in his childhood when it was a
crime punish by death for a man to eat with his wife or for a
plebeian to let his shadow fall upon the kingand now look at him an
educ christian neat and handsom dress a highmind eleg
gentleman a travel in some degre and one who has been the honor
guest of royalti in europ a man practic in hold the rein of an
enlighten govern and well vers in the polit of his countri
and in general practic inform look at him sit there
presid over the deliber of a legisl bodi among whom are
white mena grave dignifi statesmanlik personag and as seem
natur and fit to the place as if he had been born in it and had
never been out of it in his life time how the experi of this old
man event life shame the cheap invent of romanc 

the christian of the nativ has hard even weaken some of their
barbarian superstit much less destroy them i have just refer
to one of these it is still a popular belief that if your enemi can get
hold of ani articl belong to you he can get down on his knee over it
and pray you to death therefor mani a nativ give up and die mere
becaus he imagin that some enemi is put him through a cours of
damag prayer this pray an individu to death seem absurd enough
at a first glanc but then when we call to mind some of the pulpit
effort of certain of our own minist the thing look plausibl

in former time among the island not onli a plural of wive was
customari but a plural of husband likewis some nativ women of
nobl rank had as mani as six husband a woman thus suppli did not
resid with all her husband at onc but live sever month with each
in turn an understood sign hung at her door dure these month when
the sign was taken down it meant next 

in those day woman was rigid taught to know her place  her place
was to do all the work take all the cuff provid all the food and
content herself with what was left after her lord had finish his
dinner she was not onli forbidden by ancient law and under penalti of
death to eat with her husband or enter a cano but was debar under
the same penalti from eat banana pineappl orang and other
choic fruit at ani time or in ani place she had to confin herself
pretti strict to poi and hard work these poor ignor heathen seem
to have had a sort of grope idea of what came of woman eat fruit in
the garden of eden and they did not choos to take ani more chanc
but the missionari broke up this satisfactori arrang of thing
they liber woman and made her the equal of man

the nativ had a romant fashion of buri some of their children
aliv when the famili becam larger than necessari the missionari
interf in this matter too and stop it

to this day the nativ are abl to lie down and die whenev they want
to whether there is anyth the matter with them or not if a kanaka
take a notion to die that is the end of him nobodi can persuad him to
hold on all the doctor in the world could not save him

a luxuri which they enjoy more than anyth els is a larg funer
if a person want to get rid of a troublesom nativ it is onli
necessari to promis him a fine funer and name the hour and he will be
on hand to the minuteat least his remain will

all the nativ are christian now but mani of them still desert to the
great shark god for temporari succor in time of troubl an irrupt of
the great volcano of kilauea or an earthquak alway bring a deal of
latent loyalti to the great shark god to the surfac it is common
report that the king educ cultiv and refin christian
gentleman as he undoubt is still turn to the idol of his father
for help when disast threaten a planter caught a shark and one of
his christian nativ testifi his emancip from the thrall of
ancient superstit by assist to dissect the shark after a fashion
forbidden by his abandon creed but remors short began to tortur
him he grew moodi and sought solitud brood over his sin refus
food and final said he must die and ought to die for he had sin
against the great shark god and could never know peac ani more he was
proof against persuas and ridicul and in the cours of a day or two
took to his bed and die although he show no symptom of diseas
his young daughter follow his lead and suffer a like fate within the
week superstit is ingrain in the nativ blood and bone and it is
onli natur that it should crop out in time of distress wherev one
goe in the island he will find small pile of stone by the waysid
cover with leafi offer place there by the nativ to appeas evil
spirit or honor local deiti belong to the mytholog of former day

in the rural district of ani of the island the travel hour come
upon parti of duski maiden bath in the stream or in the sea
without ani cloth on and exhibit no veri intemper zeal in the
matter of hide their naked when the missionari first took up
their resid in honolulu the nativ women would pay their famili
frequent friend visit day by day not even cloth with a blush
it was found a hard matter to convinc them that this was rather
indel final the missionari provid them with long loos
calico robe and that end the difficultyfor the women would troop
through the town stark nake with their robe fold under their arm
march to the missionari hous and then proceed to dress the nativ
soon manifest a strong procliv for cloth but it was short
appar that they onli want it for grandeur the missionari
import a quantiti of hat bonnet and other male and femal wear
apparel institut a general distribut and beg the peopl not to
come to church nake next sunday as usual and they did not but the
nation spirit of unselfish led them to divid up with neighbor who
were not at the distribut and next sabbath the poor preacher could
hard keep counten befor their vast congreg in the midst of
the read of a hymn a brown state dame would sweep up the aisl with
a world of air with noth in the world on but a stovepipe hat and a
pair of cheap glove anoth dame would follow trick out in a man
shirt and noth els anoth one would enter with a flourish with
simpli the sleev of a bright calico dress tie around her waist and the
rest of the garment drag behind like a peacock tail off duti a
state buck kanaka would stalk in with a woman bonnet on wrong side
beforeon this and noth more after him would stride his fellow
with the leg of a pair of pantaloon tie around his neck the rest of
his person untrammel in his rear would come anoth gentleman simpli
gotten up in a fieri neckti and a stripe vest

the poor creatur were beam with complac and wholli unconsci
of ani absurd in their appear they gaze at each other with
happi admir and it was plain to see that the young girl were
take note of what each other had on as natur as if they had alway
live in a land of bibl and knew what church were made for here was
the evid of a dawn civil the spectacl which the
congreg present was so extraordinari and withal so move that
the missionari found it difficult to keep to the text and go on with
the servic and by and by when the simpl children of the sun began a
general swap of garment in open meet and produc some
irresist grotesqu effect in the cours of redress there was
noth for it but to cut the thing short with the benedict and
dismiss the fantast assemblag

while i was in honolulu i wit the ceremoni funer of the king
sister her royal high the princess victoria accord to the royal
custom the remain had lain in state at the palac thirti day watch
day and night by a guard of honor and dure all that time a great
multitud of nativ from the sever island had kept the palac ground
well crowd and had made the place a pandemonium everi night with their
howl and wail beat of tomtom and danc of the at other
time forbidden hulahula by halfclad maiden to the music of song
of question decenc chant in honor of the deceas the print
programm of the funer process interest me at the time and after
what i have just said of hawaiian grandiloqu in the matter of
play empir  i am persuad that a perus of it may interest the
reader

after read the long list of dignitari etc and rememb

i resum my journal at the point where the process arriv at the
royal mausoleum

as the process file through the gate the militari deploy
handsom to the right and left and form an avenu through which
the long column of mourner pass to the tomb the coffin was
born through the door of the mausoleum follow by the king and
his chief the great offic of the kingdom foreign consul
embassador and distinguish guest burlingam and general van
valkenburgh sever of the kahili were then fasten to a
framework in front of the tomb there to remain until they decay
and fall to piec or forestal this until anoth scion of
royalti die at this point of the proceed the multitud set
up such a heartbroken wail as i hope never to hear again

the soldier fire three volley of musketryth wail be
previous silenc to permit of the gun be heard his high
princ william in a showi militari uniform the true princ  this
scion of the hous overthrown by the present dynastyh was former
betroth to the princess but was not allow to marri her stood guard
and pace back and forth within the door the privileg few who
follow the coffin into the mausoleum remain sometim but the king
soon came out and stood in the door and near one side of it a stranger
could have guess his rank although he was so simpli and
unpretenti dress by the profound defer paid him by all
person in his vicin by see his high offic receiv his quiet
order and suggest with bow and uncov head and by observ
how care those person who came out of the mausoleum were to avoid
crowding him although there was room enough in the doorway for a wagon
to pass for that matter how respect they edg out sideway
scrape their back against the wall and alway present a front view
of their person to his majesti and never put their hat on until
they were well out of the royal presenc

he was dress entir in blackdresscoat and silk hatand look
rather democrat in the midst of the showi uniform about him on his
breast he wore a larg gold star which was half hidden by the lapel of
his coat he remain at the door a half hour and occasion gave an
order to the men who were erect the kahili rank of longhandl
mop made of gaudi featherssacr to royalti they are stuck in the
ground around the tomb and left there  befor the tomb he had the
good tast to make one of them substitut black crape for the ordinari
hempen rope he was about to tie one of them to the framework with
final he enter his carriag and drove away and the populac short
began to drop into his wake while he was in view there was but one man
who attract more attent than himself and that was harri the
yanke prime minist this feebl personag had crape enough around
his hat to express the grief of an entir nation and as usual he
neglect no opportun of make himself conspicu and excit the
admir of the simpl kanaka oh nobl ambit of this modern
richelieu

it is interest to contrast the funer ceremoni of the princess
victoria with those of her note ancestor kamehameha the conqueror who
die fifti year agoin  the year befor the first missionari
came

on the th of may  at the age of sixtysix he die as he
had live in the faith of his countri it was his misfortun not
to have come in contact with men who could have right influenc
his religi aspir judg by his advantag and compar
with the most emin of his countrymen he may be just style not
onli great but good to this day his memori warm the heart and
elev the nation feel of hawaiian they are proud of
their old warrior king they love his name his deed form their
histor age and an enthusiasm everywher prevail share even
by foreign who knew his worth that constitut the firmest
pillar of the throne of his dynasti

in lieu of human victim the custom of that age a sacrific of
three hundr dog attend his obsequiesno mean holocaust when
their nation valu and the estim in which they were held are
consid the bone of kamehameha after be kept for a while
were so care conceal that all knowledg of their final
rest place is now lost there was a proverb current among the
common peopl that the bone of a cruel king could not be hid they
made fishhook and arrow of them upon which in use them they
vent their abhorr of his memori in bitter execr 

the account of the circumst of his death as written by the nativ
historian is full of minut detail but there is scarc a line of it
which doe not mention or illustr some bygon custom of the countri
in this respect it is the most comprehens document i have yet met
with i will quot it entir

when kamehameha was danger sick and the priest were unabl
to cure him they said be of good courag and build a hous for
the god his own privat god or idol that thou mayest recov 
the chief corrobor this advic of the priest and a place of
worship was prepar for kukailimoku and consecr in the
even they propos also to the king with a view to prolong his
life that human victim should be sacrif to his deiti upon
which the greater part of the peopl abscond through fear of
death and conceal themselv in hide place till the tabu tabu
pronounc tahboo mean prohibit we have borrow it or
sacr the tabu was sometim perman sometim temporari and
the person or thing place under tabu was for the time be sacr
to the purpos for which it was set apart in the abov case the
victim select under the tabu would be sacr to the sacrifice
in which destruct impend was past it is doubt whether
kamehameha approv of the plan of the chief and priest to
sacrific men as he was known to say the men are sacr for the
king  mean that they were for the servic of his successor
this inform was deriv from liholiho his son

after this his sick increas to such a degre that he had not
strength to turn himself in his bed when anoth season
consecr for worship at the new templ heiau arriv he said
to his son liholiho go thou and make supplic to thi god i
am not abl to go and will offer my prayer at home  when his
devot to his feather god kukailimoku were conclud a
certain religi dispos individu who had a bird god
suggest to the king that through it influenc his sick might
be remov the name of this god was pua it bodi was made of a
bird now eaten by the hawaiian and call in their languag ala
kamehameha was will that a trial should be made and two hous
were construct to facilit the experi but while dwell in
them he becam so veri weak as not to receiv food after lie
there three day his wive children and chief perceiv that he
was veri low return him to his own hous in the even he was
carri to the eat hous where he took a littl food in his
mouth which he did not swallow also a cup of water the chief
request him to give them his counsel but he made no repli and
was carri back to the dwell hous but when near midnightten
oclock perhapsh was carri again to the place to eat but as
befor he mere tast of what was present to him then
kaikioewa address him thus here we all are your younger
brethren your son liholiho and your foreign impart to us your
die charg that liholiho and kaahumanu may hear  then kamehameha
inquir what do you say  kaikioewa repeat your counsel for
us 

he then said move on in my good way and  he could proceed no
further the foreign mr young embrac and kiss him
hoapili also embrac him whisper someth in his ear after
which he was taken back to the hous about twelv he was carri
onc more to the hous for eat into which his head enter
while his bodi was in the dwell hous immedi adjoin it
should be remark that this frequent carri of a sick chief from
one hous to anoth result from the tabu system then in forc
there were at that time six hous hut connect with an
establishmenton was for worship one for the men to eat in an
eat hous for the women a hous to sleep in a hous in which to
manufactur kapa nativ cloth and one where at certain interv
the women might dwell in seclus

the sick was onc more taken to his hous when he expir this
was at two oclock a circumst from which leleiohoku deriv his
name as he breath his last kalaimoku came to the eat hous
to order those in it to go out there were two age person thus
direct to depart one went the other remain on account of love
to the king by whom he had former been kind sustain the
children also were sent away then kalaimoku came to the hous and
the chief had a consult one of them spoke thus this is my
thoughtw will eat him raw this sound suspici in view of
the fact that all sandwich island historian white and black
protest that cannib never exist in the island howev
sinc they onli propos to eat him raw we wont count that
but it would certain have been cannib if they had cook
him m t  kaahumanu one of the dead king widow repli
perhap his bodi is not at our dispos that is more proper with
his successor our part in himhi breathha depart his
remain will be dispos of by liholiho 

after this convers the bodi was taken into the consecr
hous for the perform of the proper rite by the priest and the
new king the name of this ceremoni is uko and when the sacr hog
was bake the priest offer it to the dead bodi and it becam a
god the king at the same time repeat the customari prayer

then the priest address himself to the king and chief said
i will now make known to you the rule to be observ respect
person to be sacrif on the burial of this bodi if you obtain
one man befor the corps is remov one will be suffici but
after it leav this hous four will be requir if delay until
we carri the corps to the grave there must be ten but after it is
deposit in the grave there must be fifteen tomorrow morn
there will be a tabu and if the sacrific be delay until that
time forti men must die 

then the high priest hewahewa inquir of the chief where
shall be the resid of king liholiho  they repli where
inde you of all men ought to know  then the priest observ
there are two suitabl place one is kau the other is kohala 
the chief prefer the latter as it was more thick inhabit
the priest ad these are proper place for the king resid
but he must not remain in kona for it is pollut  this was
agre to it was now break of day as he was be carri to the
place of burial the peopl perceiv that their king was dead and
they wail when the corps was remov from the hous to the
tomb a distanc of one chain the process was met by a certain
man who was ardent attach to the deceas he leap upon the
chief who were carri the king bodi he desir to die with him
on account of his love the chief drove him away he persist in
make numer attempt which were unavail kalaimoka also had
it in his heart to die with him but was prevent by hookio

the morn follow kamehameha death liholiho and his train
depart for kohala accord to the suggest of the priest to
avoid the defil occas by the dead at this time if a
chief die the land was pollut and the heir sought a resid
in anoth part of the countri until the corps was dissect and
the bone tie in a bundl which be done the season of
defil termin if the deceas were not a chief the hous
onli was defil which becam pure again on the burial of the bodi
such were the law on this subject

on the morn on which liholiho sail in his cano for kohala
the chief and peopl mourn after their manner on occas of a
chief death conduct themselv like madmen and like beast
their conduct was such as to forbid descript the priest also
put into action the sorceri apparatus that the person who had
pray the king to death might die for it was not believ that
kamehameha departur was the effect either of sick or old age
when the sorcer set up by their fireplac stick with a strip
of kapa fli at the top the chief keeaumoku kaahumaun brother
came in a state of intox and broke the flagstaff of the
sorcer from which it was infer that kaahumanu and her friend
had been instrument in the king death on this account they
were subject to abus 

you have the contrast now and a strang one it is this great queen
kaahumanu who was subject to abuse dure the fright orgi that
follow the king death in accord with ancient custom afterward
becam a devout christian and a steadfast and power friend of the
missionari

dog were and still are rear and fatten for food by the nativ
henc the refer to their valu in one of the abov paragraph

forti year ago it was the custom in the island to suspend all law for a
certain number of day after the death of a royal personag and then a
saturnalia ensu which one may pictur to himself after a fashion but
not in the full horror of the realiti the peopl shave their head
knock out a tooth or two pluck out an eye sometim cut bruis
mutil or burn their flesh got drunk burn each other hut
maim or murder one anoth accord to the capric of the moment
and both sex gave themselv up to brutal and unbridl licenti

and after it all came a torpor from which the nation slowli emerg
bewild and daze as if from a hideous halfrememb nightmar
they were not the salt of the earth those gentl children of the sun 

the nativ still keep up an old custom of their which cannot be
comfort to an invalid when they think a sick friend is go to die
a coupl of dozen neighbor surround his hut and keep up a deafen
wail night and day till he either die or get well no doubt this
arrang has help mani a subject to a shroud befor his appoint
time

they surround a hut and wail in the same heartbroken way when it
occup return from a journey this is their dismal idea of a welcom
a veri littl of it would go a great way with most of us
